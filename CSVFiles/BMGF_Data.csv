6,"Program Officer, High School to Postsecondary Transitions","Division Summary The foundation’s U.S. Program (USP) works to expand access to life-changing opportunities. That’s why our primary focus in education is ensuring that all students – especially Black and Latino students, and students experiencing poverty – have an opportunity to earn a degree or certificate that prepares them for a successful career and fulfilling life. But often, education isn’t enough. Factors outside of schools and the classroom have an enormous impact on a student’s success. That’s why we’re also supporting efforts by public officials and community groups to better understand and advance economic mobility, leading to permanent ladders out of poverty for families and communities, such that race, ethnicity, and income are no longer predictors of outcomes. Team Summary Our US Education programs support young people along the PK-16 continuum, from Pre-Kindergarten through postsecondary. The Early Learning & Pathways team focuses across the critical transition points that are essential to supporting young people’s momentum along their education journey – early learning as the foundational platform for success in elementary school, and the latter half of high school into postsecondary, which is the launching pad for success in the workforce. Our work in early learning is focused on increasing Kindergarten-readiness among Black, Latino and children experiencing poverty such that they meet third grade benchmarks that are predictive of academic and later-life success. We invest in innovative assessments, curricula and instructional supports, along with data infrastructure and tools that drive improvement in the quality of public Pre-Kindergarten programs. Our work in Education Pathways focuses on ensuring that Black, Latino and students experiencing poverty access the learning opportunities and guidance and navigation supports needed to obtain credentials of value and gain professional skills, agency, and social capital needed to thrive in the workforce. We support high schools, postsecondary institutions, and employers to adopt and coordinate delivery of effective solutions, aligning K-12/PS programs of study with labor market demand that enable more students to be empowered and prepared to select and pursue postsecondary pathways of value.

By working to expand access to life-changing opportunities with a primary focus on education, the foundation seeks to ensure that all students –especially Black and Latinx students, and students experiencing poverty – have an opportunity to earn a degree or certificate that prepares them for a successful career and fulfilling life. The foundation understands that education alone is not enough as factors outside of schools and classrooms have an enormous impact on a student’s success. Through support to public officials and community groups, the foundation works to better understand and advance economic mobility, leading to permanent ladders out of poverty for families and communities, such that race, ethnicity, and income are no longer predictors of outcomes. USP’s goal is to help break the intergenerational cycle of poverty that prevents families and communities from accessing opportunities to reach their full potential by improving education systems and ensuring that race, ethnicity, and income are no longer predictors of outcomes. The U.S. Program works on seven key drivers toward our goal: Ensure early childhood learning systems provide high-quality early learning experiences for young children. Support schools in the K12 system in their work to improve student outcomes. Transform colleges and universities to increase student success and eliminate opportunity and attainment gaps. Create equitable access to quality education to employment pathways that enable students to obtain credentials of value and gain the professional skills, agency, and social capital to thrive in the workplace. Partner with stakeholders to ensure more effective collaborations to increase mobility from poverty, including a focus on data and evidence to close knowledge gaps and help leaders from various sectors work together to achieve even greater impact. Support improvements that will provide practitioners and policymakers with the education to workforce data and information they need to answer critical questions about student progress and to implement evidence-based reforms that equitably improve education outcomes. In the foundation’s home state of Washington, improve education from preschool through college, and strengthen community engagement, in order to ensure that every child has a chance to reach their full potential. Across our work in education, there are three keystones that anchor our strategies. These keystones are: Accelerate the development and delivery of high-quality, next generation instructional systems and digital learning resources that deliver equitable impact, with a focus on comprehensive instructional systems in early learning, math in K-12, and gateway courses in postsecondary. Enhance student transition supports that leverage technology and data to better enable counselors and advisors to engage students, increase students’ own sense of agency, and ensure equity in our priority students’ access to pathways that lead to economic mobility.
