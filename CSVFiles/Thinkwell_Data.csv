The Senior Program Analyst may supervise staff but typically serves as an individual contributor on a project team.    
 
In Kenya, the Senior Program analyst plays a key role in implementing the Service Delivery Redesign (SDR) project in Kakamega County, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Service delivery redesign (SDR) for maternal and newborn services is a vision for transforming health systems to focus on providing high quality care by ensuring that all women deliver at health facilities that offer emergency services. ThinkWell in partnership with Jacaranda Health will support the County Government of Kakamega to strengthen the health financing function to support the SDR implementation.
 
The SDR project will collaborate and leverage on learnings from the flagship project,  Strategic Purchasing for Primary health Care project (SP4PHC). The SP4PHC Kenya team works in four counties (Kilifi, Isiolo, Makueni and Kakamega).  The Senior Program Analyst is based in Kakamega and works closely with the Kakamega County Department of Health, Jacaranda Health, ADP and other partners and the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), providing technical advisory services to the county and navigating county partnerships in support of the project objectives.  The Sr. Analyst reports to the Technical Advisor, Health Care Financing.
