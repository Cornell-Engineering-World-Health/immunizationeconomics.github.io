About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
Epidemics affect livelihoods, disrupt public service delivery and undermined economic growth and human rights. At the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is realizing, once again, the need to take urgent measures to be collectively and institutionally more resilient and better prepared for future health emergencies. For UNICEF, these crises highlight the need for the organization to strengthen its capacity as a reliable partner in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery efforts.
UNICEF has worked to respond to many types of health emergencies over the past decades and understands the complexities of this type of response. The organization’s unique attributes enable it to serve as an effective partner for national governments in developing and implementing multi-sectoral emergency responses. Arguably, UNICEF is the best placed agency to bring forth essential changes to epidemic preparedness and response through its proven expertise in key sectors (i.e. community health, primary health, immunization, WASH, Risk Communication and Community Engagement, Education, Supply systems, etc.) and steer global health out of exclusive bio-medical models.
Since September 2015, the Public Health Emergencies Program (previously known as Health Emergency Preparedness Initiative – HEPI), has led this work for the agency, while supporting the response to high-profile epidemics globally.
UNICEF has become a leading organization in PHE preparedness and response and partner with communities, governments (specially at the regional/district level), non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and other UN agencies. UNICEF provides leadership in the response through its cross-sectoral approach and programming expertise, including in:

Integrated Multidisciplinary Outbreak Analytics
Health & nutrition
Infection Prevention & Control and WASH
Risk Communication & Community engagement
Psycho-Social Support
Gender responsive programming
Supply & Logistics support

In addition to the PHE control response, UNICEF works equally hard to address the impacts of   the pandemic on continuity of essential social services that support children’s health and wellbeing such as education.
Purpose & Rationale
The Public Health Emergencies team aims to take stock of UNICEF’s experience in preparedness and response and apply the lessons learned to prevent, prepare for and respond to future public health emergencies. To achieve that, the team will draft and disseminate a number of briefings and thought pieces, in collaboration with all PHE stakeholders at HQ and regional offices.
This consultancy will focus on supporting the PHE team in the review and development of key technical guidance as well as documents including digests on ongoing public health emergencies and response, outbreak reports, and review and synthesis of technical guidance and discussions. The audience of such documentation is both internal (i.e. leadership, regional and HQ technical colleagues) and external (i.e. technical partners).
Terms of Reference / Deliverables
Some of the expected items are regular (digests and reports), and others are one-off deliverables (review of technical guidance and discussion).
The consultant will regularly interact with the technical experts of the PHE team to receive the necessary technical references, documents and explanations upon which the items will be produced. Enough time should and will be allocated to the consultant to perform the items in accordance with agreed deadlines. It is possible that some products will be asked upon a very short notice. In this case and in agreement with the head of the team, priority will be given to the completion of the concerned task. He/she will also collaborate with technical experts across sections and divisions to compile technical briefings and provide feedback for review. Deliverables by the consultant will only be disseminated after review and approval by the supervisor or the Principal Advisor, PHE, both for internal and external documents
More specifically, the consultant will support the development of the following products:

Compile a PHE weekly digest based on existing UNICEF and non-UNICEF resources focusing on the Public health response components (RCCE, IPC, case management, IMOA, transmission, etc.)
Compile a bi-weekly global outbreak report for awareness of UNICEF leadership and regional offices
Participate and report on relevant technical and scientific forums, including with WHO experts’ groups
Perform preliminary scientific review of guidance submitted to the PHE team, including though WHO-UNICEF collaborative work

For every child, Education
Full-time home-based consultancy (8-11 months)  ""LearnIn Technology Consultant""
Background & Rationale
Learning is an essential human activity, and every child has the right to learn. Yet in Europe and Central Asia, more than 10.6 million children and adolescents are out of school, and an additional 17.7 million who are in school remain out-of-learning. Many learners—and disproportionately more poor and vulnerable children—develop learning gaps in both content and skills, including transferable skills, that are needed for further learning. These learning deficits are cumulative across children’s life course, driving inequality in access, educational outcomes, and well-being.
These existing challenges were exacerbated by nationwide school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected 49.8 million learners in the region. Countries provided primarily online and television-based distance learning, but a lack of clear policies, flexibility, and adequate resources at all levels left education systems ill-prepared to respond quickly, effectively, and equitably to ensure learning continuity. ICT literacy rates are low throughout ECA, presenting challenges for learners to engage with distance learning, parents to support their learning at home, and teachers to adapt to and effectively use new and diversified teaching and learning modalities.
LearnIn, conceptualized in 2019, is a UNICEF ECARO initiative that supports ECAR Country Offices (COs) to harness digital technology, innovation and partnerships for improving inclusive and quality education for all children, with an explicit focus on the most vulnerable. It reflects the belief that education access and quality can be improved by making available an education model that supports the integration of digital learning with the instructional core, building on and improving what teachers know and are accustomed to, to improve outcomes for children. The core implementation principles include: leveraging digital technologies and solutions to accelerate education improvement; contextualization and localization, human-centered design; accessibility and inclusion; flexibility; learners as the target audience; evidence-based; and sustainability and scalability.
Main implementation activities of LearnIn include:

Digital learning platforms: Work with countries’ existing platforms or, in the absence of national or school-based learner management systems, customize Learning Passport as the main platform for connecting learners with digital learning content.
Digital learning content: Partner with content providers to customize regionally and globally available content to meet local needs and curriculum alignment.
Teacher upskilling and support: Develop contextualizable and localizable frameworks on teacher competencies for digital learning and support the organization of teacher professional development.
Internet access: Leverage partnerships to provide internet connection at schools and for marginalized children at affordable cost and provide off-line solutions in schools and communities where internet access cannot be secured. 
Devices: Deliver devices to the most marginalized children in partnership with the private sector and governments.
Youth engagement: Engage youths on issues related to digital technology and innovations.

Purpose
Under the overall guidance and direction of the Regional Education Adviser, in close collaboration with ECARO Education Section, the Consultant will work for the successful deployment of the LearnIn from technological perspectives. The consultant will provide technical assistance to 1) the development of a LearnIn regional model and 2) the implementation of a LearnIn rollout plan tailored to countries’ needs.
Scope of work

But de la consultation
 
Le Congo a réalisé des progrès considérables dans la lutte contre la poliomyélite depuis 1988 date de lancement par l’Assemblée mondiale de la santé de l’Initiative mondiale pour l’éradication de la poliomyélite (IEP) pour laquelle le Congo est partie prenante.
 Aucun cas de poliovirus sauvage (PVS) n’a été rapporté au Congo depuis la fin de la dernière épidémie de 2010. Cependant, le risque d’une nouvelle importation du PVS des pays voisins est présent du fait de la baisse de performance du système de surveillance et de la faible couverture vaccinale en routine.
Malgré la mise en œuvre de cette activité en 2019 des journées locales de vaccination contre la poliomyélite sur recommandation du bureau régional de l’OMS Afrique, la faiblesse de notre système de surveillance et la résurgence des cas de polio virus dérivés de vaccin détectés en RDC, place les départements riverains de notre pays en possible situation d’importation des cas de PVDV.  L’analyse de risque conduite au Congo a retenu trois départements (Likouala, Pool et Pointe Noire) et trois districts sanitaires (Mossaka Loukoléla, Makotipoko et Ile Mbamou).
Dans ce contexte particulier, l’intensification de la recherche des cas suspects de polio ont permis de détecter un cas dans le Kouilou.
Cette nouvelle donne oblige le pays à organiser la riposte très rapidement.
 
C’est dans ce contexte que s’inscrit la présente consultation pour appuyer le pays dans l’organisation de la logistique vaccinale non seulement pour la riposte mais aussi pour faciliter l’introduction du nouveau vaccin nOPV en République du Congo.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Education
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nation.

Uganda is one of the over 190 countries and territories around the world where we work to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease, and discrimination place in a child’s path. Together with the Government of Uganda and partners we work towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the objectives of the Uganda National Development Plan, and the planned outcomes of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework.

How can you make a difference?
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
Inadequate access to hygiene and sanitation remains a significant problem in Uganda, placing the poorest and most marginalized children at high risk of diarrheal diseases and malnutrition. Between 40% and 60% of childhood malnutrition is attributed to poor WASH conditions primarily through repeated diarrhoea or intestinal infection[1].
While overall Sanitation Coverage[2] (population accessing any form of sanitation facility) in Uganda is at 78% in rural areas and 89.1% in urban areas, it is estimated that use of basic sanitation in rural areas is at 18% and in urban areas at 44.8%, while safely managed sanitation in rural areas is at 7.1% and in urban areas 38.9%. The rural population practicing open defecation is 22 % and urban 12%.
Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), which has been adopted as the core strategy for eliminating open defecation, has galvanized communities into improving their sanitation and resulted into open defecation free (ODF) villages. In Adjumani District, out of the 206 communities, 165 are claiming to be ODF, with 20 villages as certified ODF; while in Kamuli District out of 774 communities, 167 villages are claiming ODF, with 141 villages are certified ODF
While the community-led total sanitation approach has proven successful in accelerating the elimination of open defecation, it has generated a large proportion of people getting access to unimproved toilets (pit latrines without a slab or platform, that do not hygienically separate excreta from human contact and do not conform to standards of basic sanitation). Limited attention has been given so far to providing support to households to get access to higher level of sanitation services, i.e. basic sanitation services (improved facilities which are not shared with other households) or safely managed sanitation services (improved facilities which are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site) as per the JMP sanitation ladder.
As only 18% of communities in Uganda have access to basic sanitation services in rural areas, there is need to assist households to move up the sanitation ladder, to develop and apply market based sanitation approaches that will increase access to at least basic services and fast-track progress towards the achievement of SDG 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.
The Districts offer a strong opportunity to develop innovative and transformative approaches aiming at consolidating the efforts put in to mobilize communities to achieve ODF status to now  improve sanitation facility at household level through  by market-based sanitation (MBS) approach  which involves  engaging with the private sector and unlocking financial bottlenecks. UNICEF is looking for an individual consultant to work with national and district government structures to support the implementation of MBS interventions in the two districts of Adjumani and Kamuli.
The Market Based Sanitation approach to be implemented in the two focus districts of Adjumani and Kamuli is aligned to the Rolling Workplan activity 1.5.6.2 “Technical and financial assistance for strengthening sanitation marketing approaches for adoption of basic sanitation by the communities in rural and urban areas” and is expected to contribute to achieving the following results by the end of 2022:

15,000 Households in Adjumani and 15,000 Households in Kamuli gain access to basic sanitation services
at least 30,000 sanitation products (Sato pans, slabs or full toilet systems) bought, installed, and used by targeted households in Adjumani and Kamuli;
financing model supporting vulnerable households as well as entrepreneurs developed/ identified and tested;

60 Masons are trained in technical and business skills and engaged with suppliers and community members to construct or upgrade toilets.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
Background:
Giga is a joint initiative of UNICEF and United Nations International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to connect every school to the internet, and every young person to information, opportunity and choice.
According to the ITU, nearly 3.7 billion people remain unable to access the internet and disconnected from digital solutions that could dramatically improve their lives. This limits them from accessing the same information, opportunity and choice as their more-connected peers. Unless things change, a big part of this rapidly growing group of young people is in danger of being left behind - excluded from the modern digital world.
The key objective of Giga is to connect 2 million schools and approximately 500 million children and youth by the end of 2025 by: using a strong data infrastructure to identify unmet demand and monitor the quality of connectivity; developing sustainable financing models that will address current market failures in terms of infrastructure and pricing; and, using suitable new technology to extend the reach.
Giga has 4 areas in which it can provide support:

Map the location and connectivity status of all schools in the country, monitor the quality of connectivity in real-time and estimate the financial needs to bridge the digital divide in education.
Develop structured and blended finance models to attract private and public investment to connect all schools in the country to the Internet.
Advise on procurement processes for connectivity (i.e. aggregating demand for connectivity, launching a common bid, among others) to make the most efficient use of investments.
Empower young people with Digital Public Goods, or open source software solutions, that can support education, health, and the SDG agenda.

To accelerate the deployment of Giga in Uzbekistan there is a need of a National coordinator who will provide technical operational and administrative support to UNICEF Uzbekistan in implementing Giga initiative in Uzbekistan.

Purpose of Activity/Assignment
Background The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. The overall goal of the UNICEF Kosovo is to contribute to enabling all children, adolescents and young people in Kosovo, especially the most marginalized, to have their rights progressively fulfilled and to develop to their full potential in a protective and inclusive society. As such, the Kosovo Programme is rights-based, equity and gender-focused. UNICEF globally has made great strides in recent years to build a truly inclusive workplace – one in which every staff member feels welcome and valued while together carry out the shared mission for children and young people around the world. The Kosovo Office staffing structure is based on the programme design, as well as staff capacities based on a skills mapping and Belbin and Gallup Team Roles exercise. These activities showed that the Kosovo team works best when feeling productive; has a high sense of commitment to values such as honesty and loyalty; and can proactively integrate team members to achieve results. The team also shows eagerness to continuously learn, improve and recognize others’ potential, resulting in a dynamic working environment conducive to results. In contrast, the overall office showed a lower prevalence of strengths within the Influencing domain, which will be addressed through the office learning plan for 2021 and further.
Scope of Work: Consultant will support UNICEF staff on career development, performance management, data analytics and implementation of learning & development plans. The consultant should conduct tasks by analyzing and synthesizing issues and problems and interpreting established formal guidelines to address and recommend solutions or further actions required.

The consultant will work in close consultation with the office management and staff associations to address the subjects presented above, always referring to UNICEF competency framework. He/she should facilitate and contribute to encourage and maintain high professional, friendly, teamwork, and promote a respectful working environment and behavior. The consultant will support management on providing research, analysis and recommendations on a range of HR functions.

How can you make a difference?
Background
Over the past five years, Rwanda has accelerated implementation of Vision 2020, which aimed at achieving middle-income status by 2020 and the country is now set to achieve a high-income status (HIC) by 2050. The country has continued to own and lead its development process in a particularly innovative and committed way and has registered very positive development results reflected in the high levels of inclusive economic growth, notable gains in poverty reduction and gender empowerment.
Rwanda has made significant achievements in the areas of human development and is one of only a few African countries to achieve most of the MDGs. The transition from the MDGs to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was realised through the domestication process of the SDGs. In addition, the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS, 2014/15) and Integrated National Household Survey (EICV 4, 2013/2014, EICV 5, 2017/2018) data show that the country has successfully narrowed equity gaps in a number of social indicators and made great progress in delivering essential services to the most vulnerable.
In terms of Education, Rwanda has achieved significant success in education pertaining to the Millennium Development Goals, achieving universal primary education with a net enrolment rate of 98.3 per cent (98 per cent for boys; 98.5 per cent for girls) (MINEDUC, 2018). However, these gains at the primary level need to be matched with improvements in quality throughout the system. Results from the Learning Achievement in Rwandan Schools (LARS, 2018) indicate that there are significant issues in numeracy and literacy for most students in Rwanda.
Rwanda has a young population. In 2012, almost half of the roughly 10.4 million population were under the age of 18. Most children are under the age of 10, with 30% aged 0-4 years and 29% aged 5-9. The number of children as a percentage of the total population declined by 6% between 1991 and 2012, even though the actual number of all children almost doubled between 1978 and 2012.
A solid enabling environment for children’s rights and sustainable development has been established, and the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and other human rights instruments. Under Vision 2020, and successive economic growth and poverty reduction strategies, the GoR has developed a comprehensive legal system and policy environment which are supportive of children and families and lay the foundations for sustainable development.
However, several challenges remain and Rwanda is still one of the poorest countries in the world – ranked 163 out of 182 countries (Human Development Report, 2015) and 19 per cent of its population still vulnerable to multiple deprivations (HDI, 2015). The prevalence of stunting among under-five children remains high at 38 per cent. Food insecurity and chronic malnutrition are closely linked with poverty.
Rwanda’s education system boasts the highest participation rates in East Africa as well as gender parity in net and gross enrolment at the pre-primary, primary, and secondary levels. In fact, girls’ enrolment surpasses boys’ enrolment at all levels. Despite these achievements, gender disparities exist, namely in learning outcomes for girls and negative social norms that impact both boys and girls, which have been informed by a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Study on Gender in Education.
Data indicates significant dropout and repetition rates, resulting in a significant proportion of out-of-school children, especially at the upper primary and secondary levels. The Dropout and Repetition Study findings indicate that gender and location remain equity issues, while quality of education contributes to these issues. Young people in Rwanda have limited opportunities to continue education outside of formal school system and to acquire information on possible carrier/educational pathways, especially in rural communities. A third of young people (16–24 years) are not in employment, education or training (NEET). Especially, 38% of young women (14–24 years) are unemployed compared to 26% of young men of the same age.
Context of School to Work Transition
School to work transition is not linear, as young people may be studying while holding jobs, may go back to school after work, start off in irregular employment and then transition to regular employment etc. School to work transition should rather be seen as a process which enables young people to move from education to productive and decent work. This process includes preparing young people for transition whereby young people have access to and can develop the skills (i.e. knowledge, competencies, attitudes and qualifications) required by the labour market to secure, retain and thrive in productive and decent employment, and adapt to the evolving economy.
Rwanda needs young labor market entrants who are equipped with practical and employable skills in line with the needs of employers and the market, and who are flexible and adaptive to spearhead the economic and technological transformation that will carry Rwanda to middle income country status.
An analysis was undertaken to determine the employability of students after each level of education (primary, secondary, and tertiary) by the National Institute for Statistics Rwanda (NISR), through the annual Labour Force Survey Report (2018). The majority of those employed have completed secondary-level education, followed by tertiary-level and then primary-level education. Moreover, there is significant disparity between the unemployment levels of adolescents and adults, where adolescents are more than twice as likely to be unemployed.
The National Tracer Survey for TVET and Higher Education Graduates and Employer Satisfaction of March 2019 found that concerning the employment status of TVET graduates, the employment rate within 6 months after graduation was 64.9% in TVET schools and 75.2% in polytechnics. As for the underemployment rate, 40.6% of TVET graduates and 38.4% of polytechnics graduates were underemployed. The employment rate of higher education graduates within 6 months after graduation was 76%. The underemployment rate of higher education graduates was 18.5%.
Similar to the employment, unemployment and underemployment rate, the longer time gap between graduation and employment was due to lack of job opportunities. However, it was important to note that the weaker the industries in the specific business sectors were, the longer the graduates of relevant fields of study took to secure their first jobs. On the other hand, the higher degree the graduates achieved, the shorter time the graduates took to secure their first jobs, because employers are likely to prefer high degree holders regardless of their business sectors.
To better support students after each level of education, there is a need to map all pathways that would orient them based on labor market skill set need and required practical knowledge.
Justification
To provide appropriate support to students, Career Guidance and Counseling Unit was introduced in REB in March 2018 for Rwandan schools with a mandate to conceptualize, develop and ensure the implementation of strategies aiming at addressing social and professional needs for teachers. Additionally, to ensure follow-up on guidance and counseling activities in schools; organize teachers’ trainings in the field of Career Guidance and Counseling. Career Guidance and Counseling Unit has to keep the liaison between districts levels especially District Education Officers and other stakeholders involved in Career Guidance and Counseling; develop, produce, distribute and experiment guides for officers in charge of Guidance and Counseling.
One of the aims of the Rwandan curriculum is to ensure that young people’s skills are better matched to the needs of the Rwandan, regional, and global labor market, and this is reflected through the emphasis on developing entrepreneurship skills. There is also a specification for teachers to be trained to provide career guidance and counselling, and to raise awareness among young learners of the influence of social factors, behavior and personal attitudes on their futures.
Students need appropriate guidance for them to make a better choice after each level of education because many of them are uninformed of their options to progress throughout the education system or to work programmes.
It is against this background that UNICEF and MINEDUC/REB are hiring an individual consultant to support MINEDUC and REB to develop career pathways from P6 to tertiary level. The mapping of pathway and the development of career options would enable Rwandan children and youth to take options that are suitable and would save the country from wastage in education and lead to employment.

I. BACKGROUND
The business sector plays an important role in the well-being of children in the community in which they operate. Businesses have a strong impact on the life of their employees, their consumers, their suppliers, and on the communities they serve. From determining the working conditions, health coverage, training and employability of workers, to the environmental impact of their operations on the community, and the taxes levied by public authorities, private stakeholders and business organizations have a critical impact on children’s and society’s well-being. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) identify children, alongside indigenous people, women and migrant workers (among others), as a particularly vulnerable group of rights holders, who may require particular attention from business as part of their human rights due diligence responsibilities. Children have a stake in business as consumers, dependents of employees, young workers, future employees, business leaders and as citizens in the communities and environments in which business operates. Business – whether large or small – therefore inevitably interacts with and affects the lives of children.Understanding and partnering with business as one of the key stakeholders – along with government, civil society and local communities – is vital for achieving results at scale. UNICEF brings more than 70 years of field-tested expertise, a network that spans more than 190 countries and territories, a passion for innovation, and a commitment to make every dollar count. Together with the world’s leading companies, corporate foundations and private organizations, UNICEF aims to harness our collective strengths to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and help children survive, thrive and fulfil their potential.There are approximately 1.7 million registered private companies in Turkey, representing a large potential for future various collaborations and partnerships. The new UNICEF Turkey Country Program Document (CPD) for 2021-2025 identifies a key role for business under Outcome 4, which aims to ensure that “public and private entities and civil society demonstrate a shared commitment and increased investments in child rights” by 2025. Moreover, in line with UNICEF’s “Business for Results” approach and taking into account the critical role of the private sector in achieving sustainable change for children, shared value partnerships with multi-national corporations, national companies and small- to medium-sized businesses are expected to contribute to accelerate results for children across most priority areas of the country program over the next five years. In order to , to support the future engagement of the National Committee for UNICEF in Turkey and the UNICEF Turkey Country Office with the private/ business sector in support of the main programmatic priorities of its 2021-2025 Country Program, there is a need to adapt the current program documents and plans into a series of concept notes specifically tailored to the needs and expectations of private sector partners. These concept notes aim to mobilize private sector support to UNICEF in key areas, with a specific focus on integrated early childhood development and skills development and engagement of adolescents and young people. In view of the above, UNICEF Turkey is seeking the services of an international individual consultancy to develop such “modular” concept notes, using available evidence, including the approved UNICEF Turkey CPD, its Programme Strategy Notes and any other relevant documents which may be useful, while giving due consideration to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda, UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, UNICEF Gender Action Plan 2018-2021, and main national and global priorities.
II. PURPOSE of the ASSIGNMENT
The consultant will take the lead in the drafting of tailor-made concept notes based on the priorities of the new CPD (2021-2025) in the areas of early childhood development and adolescent and youth development, which are considered to be areas of high potential for collaboration between UNICEF and the private sector in Turkey. A vital part of the assignment is to be able to adapt the technical language of the UNICEF CPD into a more “private sector” friendly narrative, using a “modular approach”, adapting each concept note into three categories, depending on the scale of potential collaboration with small, medium-sized and large companies. It is expected that the concept notes will also include metrics which enable reporting of aggregated results, leveraging different modalities of business engagement depending on the nature and size of contribution and partnership, as well as diversified funding streams (e.g. donations, grants, foundations, etc.).
III. DESCRIPTION of the ASSIGNMENT
Under the guidance and supervision of the Programme Specialist of UNICEF Turkey Country Office, and in close collaboration with the Deputy Representative and programme sections, the consultant is expected to produce and submit the following deliverables:
 Desk review of available key analytical, planning and programme documents on TCO CPD 2021-2025 to understand its priorities and key targets, and their alignment to the national, regional and global agenda and priorities, with focus on UNICEF private sector agenda.  Analyse available data from multiple sources inside and outside UNICEF to extract best practices and lessons learnt in view of UN and other public - private sector collaborations. Coordinate and consolidate inputs from relevant programme sections regarding possible areas of engagement of private sector in the selected programme areas.  Develop two complete “modular” concept notes on outcomes 1 and 2 of the 2021-2025 CPD (Early Childhood Development and Youth Engagement), including a narrative which reflects business-friendly language and identifies opportunities for engagement and partnership beyond funding contributions (such as employee engagement, leveraging of business assets, market shaping, etc.)  Refine and finalize the two draft concept notes mentioned above based on feedback received from the TCO program teams and management. Perform any other task related to and in support of the above-mentioned priorities.
In addition, for the purpose of reviewing, discussing and validating submitted materials, the consultant will be requested to deliver presentations to UNICEF. Therefore, a total of two presentations are expected (on draft concept notes and on final versions of the concept notes).All submissions should be electronic. All materials submitted to UNICEF should be delivered in English.

For every child,
BackgroundThe Ministry Education and Science of the Republic of Tajikistan has maintained a long-term partnership with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). Tajikistan joined GPE in 2005 and has since received eight grants from GPE: three education sector plan development grants (ESPDG), two program development grants (PDG), and three education sector plan implementation grants (ESPIG). These grants have been detrimental in introducing key reforms in education in recent years guided by the National Strategy on Education Development 2020 and the Medium-Term Education Action Plans 2012-2014, 2015â€“2017 and 2018-2020. Recently, the country has approved the new Education Sector Plan until 2030 and MTEAP 2021-2025 which paves the path for new reforms in education sector for the next ten years.
In 2021, GPE has confirmed its support to Tajikistan in achieving the priorities of the NSED until 2030 by prioritizing the country as a country to access System Transformation Grant (STG), System Capacity Grant (SCG) and Multiplier Grant (MG).  The STG has two primary purposes. The first is to catalyze progress in four areas that enable education system transformation: domestic finance; gender responsive sector planning and monitoring; data and evidence as well as sector coordination. The second is to support countries to achieve system transformation through focused and evidence-based investments within the broader sector framework to unlock system bottlenecks. In addition, the GPE Board has also replaced the previous Education Sector Plan Development Grant (ESPDG) with a more comprehensive and flexible System Capacity Grant (SCG). The SCG will provide support to system-wide capacity strengthening, including but not limited to support to education sector planning and analysis. The Multiplier Grant is aimed to provide the country an opportunity to leverage additional external financing for education.
Ministry of Education and Science has already started the process of preparation for the application process by starting a conversation with the Local Education Group on development of a partnership compact document. This document is aimed at analyzing the enabling factors for transformation of the education system, included domestic financing, sector planning and monitoring, sector coordination and data systems and highlight the bottlenecks which might potentially be address through this cycle of GPE grants.
It is within this context that UNICEF Tajikistan Country Office, in close consultation with the MoES, seeks to hire a national expert who will provide technical assistance and guidance to the MoES and other relevant stakeholders for development of a comprehensive Partnership Compact Document. As part of the process, additional technical expertise is expected to be provided by the national experts in identifying key priorities and associated financial requirements, in line with national education sector development strategy 2030. 
PURPOSE: The purpose of the consultancy is to facilitate the discussion between MoES and Local Education Group (LEG) on identifying the bottlenecks to transformational change of the system and guide the development of the Partnership Compact Document. A comprehensive report and related documents including factsheet on financial requirements and power point presentation will be developed. GPE will issue a detailed guidance on the requirements for the development of the Compact Document.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT: 
The specific objectives of this assignment are as follows:

To review strategic documents, including Compact/GPE guidelines;
Support the MoES Working Group/Coordination Union in understanding the requirements for Compact document and the overall process of preparation for GPE application.
Liaise with the MoES senior management to revise and finalize the ToR for LEG
Conduct comprehensive consultations with DCC LEG members and the MOES;
Draft the Partnership Compact Document and ensure feedback from the MoES and development partners are included.
Develop complementary documentation including factsheet on key priorities and financial requirements in the form of investment case for supporting education targets.
Provide technical guidance to UNICEF and MoES on key areas for systems strengthening.

Finalize the document and deliver presentation to key stakeholders.

For every child, a safe home
Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges.
UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves. 
In particular, UNICEF will work so that:

Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

How can you make a difference?
The primary purpose of this assignment is to conduct a human-rights based and equity-focused situation analysis (SitAn) of children with disabilities with respect to a disaggregated assessment of the status of and trends in the realization of children’s rights (CRC and CRPD). In addition, the SitAn intends to gain a deeper understanding of the immediate, underlying structural causes, issues of stigma and discrimination, other socio-cultural factors that prevent children with disabilities from enjoying all their rights, and the interrelated roles of duty-bearer institutions.
The SitAn aims to highlight disparities and vulnerabilities and to investigate notions of the rights of and attitudes towards children with disabilities. It will also highlight the existing gender disparities. Therefore, it aims to contribute to identifying areas where the achievement of national and international development goals regarding these children can be accelerated, including sustainable development goals (SDGs), and to assess the extent of the inclusiveness of policy delivery and social protective measures, including social budgeting. The findings and recommendations that stem from the SitAn will inform evidence-based planning and decision making by all stakeholders and will also identify concrete interventions to improve the lives of children with disabilities in Pakistan.
To make a difference, you will be accountable for the following tasks and deliverables:
Tasks:

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

For every child, a safe home
Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges.
UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves. 
In particular, UNICEF will work so that:

Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

The SitAn aims to highlight disparities and vulnerabilities and to investigate notions of the rights of and attitudes towards children with disabilities. It will also highlight the existing gender disparities. Therefore, it aims to contribute to identifying areas where the achievement of national and international development goals regarding these children can be accelerated, including sustainable development goals (SDGs), and to assess the extent of the inclusiveness of policy delivery and social protective measures, including social budgeting. The findings and recommendations that stem from the SitAn will inform evidence-based planning and decision making by all stakeholders and will also identify concrete interventions to improve the lives of children with disabilities in Pakistan.

Contexto
La inversión en la infancia y adolescencia constituye la base para asegurar el bienestar de las familias, la cohesión social, la productividad y el desempeño económico futuros de una sociedad. El análisis de la inversión en Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes (NNA) es relevante no sólo por razones normativas asociadas al cumplimiento y vigilancia de la Ley sino por el impacto generacional en el futuro y la coyuntura demográfica y política que enfrenta el país.
Para UNICEF México es de vital importancia centrar los derechos de los NNA entre las prioridades gubernamentales, particularmente en las decisiones presupuestarias con el fin de contar con una asignación de recursos suficiente, eficiente, efectiva, equitativa y transparente que garantice el cumplimiento de los derechos de los NNA. Para ello, lleva a cabo diversos análisis para los cuales el Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federación (PEF) y, en particular, el Anexo Transversal de Recursos para la Atención de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes (Anexo Transversal) son los principales insumos.
El gobierno en la actual administración ha determinado orientar el gasto público para la atención de grupos vulnerables como lo son: adultos mayores, madres trabajadoras, niñas, niños y adolescentes, población indígena y población con discapacidad permanente; principalmente. Así, en mayo de 2020, se aprobó la reforma al artículo 4 de la Constitución en donde el Estado garantiza, entre otros derechos, la entrega de apoyos económicos a las personas con discapacidad permanente, priorizando grupos vulnerables en condición de pobreza; asimismo, se establece que se otorgarán becas para las y los estudiantes de todos los niveles escolares del sistema de educación pública. En términos presupuestarios, los programas a los que se dirige este cambio constitucional y que son prioritarios para el Gobierno Federal, son: “Beca de Educación Básica para el Bienestar Benito Juárez”, “Pensión para personas con Discapacidad Permanente”, “Beca Benito Juárez para Educación Media Superior”, entre otros.
En 2020 UNICEF México elaboró el documento “La Infancia y la adolescencia en el Proyecto de Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federación 2021 (PPEF)”[1] para el cual se realizó un análisis de los recortes e incrementos en aquellos programas que tienen mayor impacto en el bienestar de la infancia y adolescencia entre los que se encuentran los prioritarios antes mencionados. Durante el 2021, UNICEF México continuará con el análisis del presupuesto público para la infancia y adolescencia; sin embargo, se abordará desde diferentes perspectivas y momentos del presupuesto: ejercicio del gasto trimestral, análisis del proyecto de presupuesto 2022 y cuenta pública 2018-2020 tanto del PEF total como del Anexo Transversal con el fin de contar con un panorama general de cuánto, cómo y en qué se invierten los recursos públicos para la infancia. Este ejercicio se verá reflejado en un documento de observaciones y recomendaciones para el PEF 2022, así como en presentaciones de aspectos a destacar para los oficiales de UNICEF México.
Si bien el análisis del PEF total y del Anexo Transversal en sus distintos momentos otorga una perspectiva general de aquellos programas con mayores asignaciones, es imprescindible determinar la suficiencia presupuestal de los programas prioritarios con el fin de garantizar el cumplimiento de los derechos del artículo 4 Constitucional. Para ello durante 2021, UNICEF México llevará a cabo análisis y costeos de los programas mencionados para determinar su suficiencia presupuestal, cobertura y distribución geográfica de los beneficiarios.
Adicionalmente, en noviembre de 2020 entró en vigor la reforma a la Ley de Migración y la Ley sobre Refugiados, Protección Complementaria y Asilo Político mediante las cuales se garantizarán de manera más efectiva el cumplimiento de los derechos de la niñez y adolescencia migrante, solicitante de asilo y refugiada. Estas reformas implican, entre otros, un reajuste en las funciones y responsabilidades de las autoridades competentes como lo son el Sistema Nacional DIF, Instituto Nacional de Migración y las Procuradurías de Protección de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes que tendrán un impacto presupuestario para el ejercicio fiscal 2022. UNICEF México ha resaltado la importancia de una asignación presupuestal suficiente que garantice los recursos humanos y técnicos necesarios para una implementación efectiva de dichas reformas, por lo que, durante 2021 apoyará con los análisis correspondientes para determinar la inversión necesaria para la implementación de estas reformas legislativas a nivel subnacional.
Objetivo 
El principal propósito de esta consultoría es contribuir con asistencia técnica puntual en las actividades relacionadas con el análisis y seguimiento del presupuesto público destinado a niñas, niños y adolescentes desde una perspectiva programática/sectorial (educación, nutrición, protección social, migración, adolescencia) y temporal del presupuesto público (avance trimestral, presupuesto y cuenta pública).  Para ello, el consultor(a) construirá y analizará las bases de datos públicas tanto del PEF 2018-2022 y cuenta pública 2018-2021, como del Anexo Transversal utilizando el software R y Excel.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, innovate...
UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.
The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions.
UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:

Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.
Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.
Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.

How can you make a difference?
The External Engagement Specialist will support the Office of Innovation in developing and delivering communications strategies for UNICEF Ventures, and supporting the external communications of the Giga Initiative.

External communications of the UNICEF Venture Fund, including the calls for proposal for new startup companies, capturing and sharing stories from the portfolio startups, country offices and across portfolios
Develop packages for capacity building of startups in external communications and engagement
Aligning external communications content across the initiatives of UNICEF Ventures and the Digital Public Goods Alliance and capturing and sharing stories on how UNICEF Ventures initiatives contribute to Digital Public Goods
External communications of the Giga initiative, including capturing and sharing stories of mapping and connecting schools across Giga countries, product launches, partnerships, and major events involving Giga
Aligning external communications content with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) communications team on Giga

1. Contexte
Dans le cadre de la lutte contre les violences faites aux enfants Comores, l’UNICEF accompagne le Gouvernement de l’Union des Comores dans l’élaboration des politiques et stratégies et la mise en place des structures qui s’occupent de la prise en charge des victimes de violence. Depuis 2004 et 2006, trois services d’écoute et de protection des enfants victimes de violences sont opérationnels, respectivement dans chacune des iles. Deux services d’écoute additionnels ont été mis en place en décembre 2018 afin d’améliorer la couverture. Les objectifs de ces services d’écoute sont de sensibiliser la population à dénoncer tout cas d’abus et de maltraitance à l’encontre des enfants, d’encourager les enfants victimes d’abus et de maltraitance à parler de leurs souffrances et à dénoncer les auteurs de ces violences, d’assurer une prise en charge médicale et psychologique des enfants victimes et d’initier des actions en justice contre les auteurs d’abus envers ces enfants. Ces services d’écoute assurent la prise en charge juridique, médicale et psychologique des victimes de violence. En 2020, près de 650 victimes ont eu recours aux prestations de ces services d’écoute dont 454 ont bénéficié d’une assistance médicale et 261 d’une assistance juridique.
En 2019, l’UNICEF a financé l’evaluation du service d’écoute et de prise en charge des enfants victimes de violences de Ngazidja. Cette évaluation avait notamment pour but d’analyser la pertinence et l’efficacité du service d’écoute, d’identifier des facteurs contextuels du service d’écoute qui auraient contribué à l’atteinte des meilleurs résultats, de mesurer le degré d’atteinte des résultats du service d’écoute d’analyser les contraintes, les succès et défis du service d’écoute et les leçons apprises et de formuler les recommandations en vue d’améliorer les performances du service d’écoute. A l’issue de cette evaluation, des défaillances ont été relevées notamment dans la gestion des cas des victimes. Les recommandations formulées par cette evaluation ont porté notamment sur le développement d’une démarche qualité au niveau des Services d’écoute qui consiste en un processus d’amélioration continue de la qualité des prestations fournies par les manuels de procédures, et la production d’un manuel de gestion des cas. Ces recommandations cadrent avec celles formulées en 2016 par l’evaluation du système de protection de l’enfant en Union des Comores. L’absence d’un manuel et de directives de gestion de cas, destinés aux travailleurs sociaux qui apportent assistance aux enfants victimes de violences, relevée dans les évaluations du système de protection et du service d’écoute constitue un handicap dans la réponse holistique, adaptée aux besoins spécifiques de protection des enfants victimes de violences. L’UNICEF lance une consultation nationale qui a pour but de pallier cette défaillance et de doter les travailleurs sociaux d’un manuel de gestion de cas.
 
2. Objectif général
Mettre à la disposition des acteurs de la protection de l’enfant de l’Union des Comores, un outil technique et pédagogique pour améliorer la qualité du travail social et de la prise en charge des enfants victimes de violences.
 
3. Objectifs spécifiques

Les phases suivantes de l’évaluation devront être respectées :
Phase 1 : Réunion avec la plateforme des acteurs de la protection de l’enfant afin de s’accorder sur les différentes étapes de cet exercice, les normes et standards en matière d’établissement des directives de gestion de cas.
Phase 2 : Collecte d’information (essentiellement à travers de interviews pour répondre aux différentes questions posées par la consultation). Le consultant ou la consultante exploitera des données de la cartographie et de l’evaluation du système de protection aux Comores, du rapport d’evaluation du service d’écoute de Ngazidja et autres documents pertinents portant sur la protection de l’enfance. Il visitera les acteurs de protection des iles de Ngazidja, Mwali et Ndzuwani pour collecter leurs avis.
 
Phase 3 : Elaboration du draft du manuel de gestion des cas.
 
Phase 4 : Organisation et facilitation de l’atelier de validation du manuel de gestion des cas regroupant tous les acteurs de la protection de l’enfant.

How can you make a difference?
Background
In Romania, the National Strategy on the promotion and protection of children’s rights (2014-2020) and the National Strategy on poverty reduction and social inclusion (2015-2020) included a number of measures and actions targeting particularly most vulnerable children and their families in order to reduce poverty and inequities and to promote social inclusion. Several initiatives were implemented in the last couple of years, but still today there is one in every 3 children who is at risk of poverty in Romania[1]. Even if AROP and AROPE indicators register a slightly decreasing trend in the last couple of years, still Romania lags in the EU raking. Moreover, in the current context influenced by COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected that even small progress achieved lately, will display its fragility and nowadays’ recession will push more people into poverty, and will further affect those already at risk.
Currently Romania is in the process of developing new National Strategies including on child rights, on poverty reduction and social inclusion and other sectoral strategies which will also input the elaboration of new Operational Programmes for EU structural funds 2021-2027 and Recovery and Resilience National Plan 2021-2026, matching the state budget for continuing various reforms and contributing to achievements of SDGs and EU targets for 2030. Starting with the EC Recommendation for Investing in Children (2013 and consecutive country reports[2]) and continuing with the Country Specific Recommendations (see latest in 2020[3]), the new EU call on ensuring a Child Guarantee for children[4], all policy recommendations targeting child poverty and social exclusion are embedded in the paradigm promoting increased investments for children. However, in the current crises situation, increased investments for children and their families need to rely rather in promoting innovative and cost-effective solutions, in use of all opportunities of EU funding, and prioritization of structural reform measures that can contribute to the breaking the cycle of disadvantage and that go beyond ensuring children’s material security and promote equal opportunities so that all children can realize their full potential.
 
Current context
Much evidence on cost-effective measures for social inclusion of most vulnerable was already produced and collected, including from evaluations of previous strategies, models implemented at local level aiming to offer country-wide solutions, current situation analyses on various topics, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children’s wellbeing, etc. Costing exercises performed for various models (including the latest on the Minimum Package of Services) as well as financial impact analyses executed for highlighting bottlenecks and facilitating factors within the current budgeting process at national and local level, are available and were already used for the models’ scale-up (including MPS). The latter includes recommendations for scenarios describing the budget allocation at central level from the VAT and income tax deducted amounts, allotted to local public institutions for balancing off local budgets related to specific social services provision (for the social assistance and educational components), the health insurance special fund (for the health care component) and the consolidated budget with the specific social and cultural related expenses (for all components). Additionally, to the State and local budget, several financing options were suggested to be employed to support the scaling up of the MPS such as EU[5] or World Bank funding, Norway Grants, EEA Grants and Swiss Grants, etc.
Considering the accumulated evidence and as well the current and future funding opportunities for securing the initial investment costs from other sources than the national budget, UNICEF Romania is committed to continue working and exploring investment options in the benefit of children’s wellbeing, ie. costing and financing of effective and efficient national scale solutions addressing child poverty and social exclusion.
Purpose of the Consultancy
The purpose of the current consultancy is to provide public finance technical assistance for UNICEF’s public finance for children work planned for 2021, which aims to reduce child poverty and social exclusion. The focus of the consultancy will be on:
1) the investment case for cash and care for children[6] ;

Health services in South Sudan remain extremely constrained and, where functional, have focused on ad hoc services intermittently accessed by communities with women and children the worst affected. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world (789 deaths per 100,000 live births), as well as a mortality rate for children aged under five years of 96 per 1000 live births, with over 65 per cent occurring soon after birth or the first year of life. Most of these deaths, however, are preventable. UNICEF remains committed to emergency lifesaving preventive, and curative activities, and has been at the forefront of responding to infectious disease
outbreaks. Under the guidance of the Health Manager, the Health Specialist will be responsible for the development, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the health programme interventions to ensure the survival and well-being of children and mothers, and the affected communities.

UNICEF Nepal Country Programme (2018-2022) recognizes Communication for Development as an important programme component to promote behavioural and social change by engaging key stakeholders at all levels, strengthening their capacities and confidence and promote meaningful dialogue and positive actions that contribute to social change. C4D envisions to build capacity and raise awareness, address harmful social norms through social behaviour change communication strategy to Health, Nutrition, WASH, Education and Child Protection. 
The province performs poorly on most of the social development indicator compared to the national average. Health and nutrition indicators – neonatal, infant and under-five mortality rates, for instance, are all significantly higher than the national average. Immunization coverage is also lower than the national average, with over 43,000 children still not fully immunized, and a higher percentage of children under five who suffer stunting or wasting or are underweight for their age. 
Over 102,000 households across the province still don’t enjoy regular water supply, and over 53,000 homes don’t have latrines. Birth registration rates are also low in the province: there are 278,723 children under five who have not been registered. 
As far as education is concerned, enrollment at the pre-primary level is around 60 per cent, compared to 82.5 per cent nationwide. A total of 147,030 children (56 per cent girls) between 5-12 years of age are not in school, while a total of 261,061 children (53 per cent girls) between 13-16 years of age are deprived of access to secondary education. 
As high as 58 per cent of women between 20 to 24 years of age report that they were married before the age of 18. Child labour is another key issue, with 28.7 per cent of children between five to 17 years of age reportedly engaged in labour. 
In terms of exposure to media, television is the most popular medium for both men and women aged 15-49 years, followed closely by the Internet. Mobile phone ownership, while lower than the national average in the case of women, is higher for men between 15-49 years of age: 92 per cent own mobile phones.

To help them fulfill their potential.Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.And we never give up.For every child, a fair chance
Background
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations. For more than two decades, UNICEF works closely with the national government, local representatives and civil society to improve the situation of children in Kazakhstan, ensuring equal access to quality social services, and primarily, healthcare and education.

These reports detail what UNICEF Senegal achieved with the generous contribution of donors, working with diverse partners at the country level, and examine the impact of these accomplishments on the lives of children and families.

The current COVID-19 Pandemic has affected more than 150 million learners in Latin America and the Caribbean Region, where most countries have closed schools to prevent the further transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Decisions about school closures during public health emergencies are complex and highly context-specific, especially when dealing with new viruses, about which much remains unknown. As governments and health authorities are deciding whether and when to close schools and other public institutions in response to a public health crisis, prolonged school closures are having major adverse consequences on children and adolescents, particularly of the most vulnerable populations.
The longer children are out of school, the higher the risks that vulnerable children will not return. Children and adolescents from the poorest households are already almost five times more likely to be out of primary school than those from the richest. Being out of schools puts children and adolescents, especially girls, at increased risk of teenaged pregnancy, sexual abuse, child marriage and other dangers. These negative impacts will be significantly higher for children and adolescents living in the poorest countries and those affected by conflict, increasing inequality.
School closures should not negate a child’s or adolescent’s right to education. Solid plans and flexible measures should be implemented to ensure the continuity of education and support learning opportunities. These efforts must aspire to reach all children and adolescents through appropriate mechanisms, tools and platforms, with due consideration for the most vulnerable groups such as girls, children and adolescents on the move and refugees, with disabilities, living in the most remote communities, from poor and low-income families and indigenous populations.
UNICEF LACRO contributes to ensuring that every girl, boy and adolescent in LAC benefits from policies, programmes and interventions that guarantee their access to education and learning opportunities from early childhood, through primary and secondary education. Programming efforts prioritize delivering results for children who are most at risk of not fulfilling their right to education, particularly, out-of-school children, children with disabilities, children who suffer discrimination because of their ethnicity, and those affected by armed violence, and emergencies.
In this context, the generation and exchange of information, advocacy and external communication efforts are essential for UNICEF LACRO to mobilize support from governments, donors, other agencies of the United Nations System, civil society organizations and communities so that all adolescents in the region can fulfil their right to an inclusive and equitable quality education, in line with the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and the SDG4: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”

Background and Justification 
South Africa confirmed its first cluster of COVID-19 cases on 5 March 2020, imported from Europe by returning residents. South Africa has the highest COVID-19 burden in Africa and ranks 15th globally, accounting for an estimated 1.4 per cent cases and 1.9 per cent of deaths reported. As of 5 February 2021, a total of 1,466,767 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in South Africa, with an overall case fatality ratio of 3.1%.
In December 2020, South Africa identified a new SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2 which has since been reported in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Comoros, Zambia and in 24 non-African nations. This is thought to have fuelled South Africa’s ongoing second wave, of COVID-19 whose trend has been much steeper and higher than the first.
To curb ongoing transmission, prevent additional morbidity and mortality and achieve herd immunity, the Government of South Africa is committed to urgently introducing COVID-19 vaccination. According to the South African national plan, the achievement of herd immunity depends on 67% of the population developing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection or reducing their infectiousness. The success of the vaccination programme for Covid-19 will therefore contribute to achieving herd immunity.
The Government of South Africa has outlined a national COVID-19 vaccine roll out. This involves three phases: Phase 1 would focus on front-line health workers with a target population of 1.25 million; Phase 2 would include essential workers with a target population of 2.5 million, people older than 60 (5 million) and people older than 18 with co-morbidities (8 million); and Phase 3 would target other people older than 18 with a target population of 22.5 million.
UNICEF South Africa Country Office is seeking to engage 6 provincial cold chain managers to support the optimal management of vaccines and contribute to effective planning and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine introduction in the selected provinces. 
Scope of Work 
1)    Goal and Objective:  Under the direction and guidance of the UNICEF South Africa Chief of Health and Nutrition, the provincial cold chain management consultants, will support the provincial department of Health to support the optimal management of vaccines in the selected provinces with the goal of contributing to the reduction of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. 
2)    Provide details/reference to AWP areas covered: Output 1.1.7 - Support National Preparedness Planning and provide technical support to NDOH on continuation of priority MNCH, HIV and nutrition interventions in the context of COVID-19.
3)    Activities and Tasks:   
1.     Optimal vaccine and cold chain management (30%)
1.1. Maintain and ensure a constant cost-effective supply and storage of heat sensitive products.
1.2. Ensure that relevant updated cold chain information is available to all staff involved in the cold chain.
·     Ensure adequate formal and in-service training of all staff involved in cold chain and vaccine management.
·     Ensure the efficient usage of vaccines by limiting wastage and monitoring of activities.
·     Conduct monitoring and evaluation visits to facilities.
·     In the event of a cold chain failure at any level assist the pharmacist with making a decision on action to be taken and/or liaise with the national cold chain manager.
1.3. Ensure adherence to policies regarding safe disposal and destruction of used sharps, syringes and expired/wasted stock.
1.4. Risk management by identifying cold chain challenges through rapid assessment to determine adequacy (including transport and waste management capacities) at all levels, identify gaps and advise the medical depot and facilities on how to solve the problems.
1.5. Identify training needs of health workers including reverse cold chain, and conduct training to address them.

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does - in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life - in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions - her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens - addressing inequity - not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, results
Italy remains one of the main entry points into Europe for refugees and migrants fleeing conflicts, situations of violence and deprivation. Between 2014 and 2018, more than 70,000 unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) arrived in Italy by sea, 90 per cent of whom were between 15 and 17 years old. The continued significant presence of UASC (around 5,000 in reception centres in December 2020)) and the growing number of UASC who have turned 18 (around 60,000 over the last five years) are a cause for concern.  In transit and at destination, UASC and young migrants and refugees continue to face many challenges and many gaps remain in the realization of their rights. One of the key issues of concern is that they do not feel heard and do not have anybody to talk to.  Although they should be adequately informed about the decisions that affect them and their opinion taken into account, this does not seem to happen in practice. Building opportunities for them to engage in issues of concern to them in their local community not only supports their present and future civic engagement, but also contributes to their communities and societies.
To respond to these challenges, in 2016 UNICEF’s migrant and refugee response in Italy has modelled, piloted and rolled out U-Report on the Move, an adapted version of U-Report for UASC and young migrants and refugees. U-report is a mobile phone-based technology that provides a forum of opinion and information sharing for children, adolescents and adults. Using a crowd-sourcing approach to initiate a virtual dialogue with the members (‘U-reporters’), through U-report youth are able to respond to weekly polls and be agents of change in their communities. The ultimate aim of the programme is to stimulate citizen-led and adolescent/youth-led development. Once the information is collected the data is instantly analyzed. The information is subsequently utilized in communication and advocacy work across all media channels, many UNICEF programmes and through general partner engagement.
With nearly 6,000 U-Reporters registered by end 2020, U Report on the Move Italy is considered a best practice model within the U Report community and many of its features are replicated by other On the Move platforms globally.  Alongside online promotions via Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, in 2021 scale up efforts are being boosted by a team of Social Mobilizers responsible for promoting the platform in reception centers hosting unaccompanied and separated children, young migrants and refugees and fostering their engagement and participation.  A dedicated App will also soon be piloted and rolled out for this purpose. The digital community relies on a pool of U-Ambassadors, young advocates from the migrant and refugee community who promote registration of U Reporters and participate in national and international high-level fora.  U-Ambassadors also participate in the U-blog platform and U-pod, a spinoff of U Report on the Move for engagement via blogging and podcasts.  The U-Partner platform, as a tool for individual case management, has become a key aspect of the platform, with a focus on legal case management and mental health support.  Likewise, Live Chat sessions and audio-visual material have become a key feature of the platform providing life protecting information to increase access to and uptake of services and generating a high level of engagement.  In 2021 a new platform, U Report Italy, dedicated to Italian youth will be deployed jointly by the Migrant and Refugee Response team and Italian National Committee for UNICEF.
How can you make a difference?
UNICEF’s migrant and refugee response in Italy is looking for a consultant to continue manage the existing programme as well as to ensure its continued upscale, in particular through its deployment and adaptation on a number of digital platforms.
This work will contribute to building Italy's capacity to plan, develop, monitor and evaluate national and local capacity to ensure the protection, care and social inclusion of UASC and young migrants and refugees and foster their participation and empowerment. UNICEF and partners will use the information for advocacy and more focused programming for UAMs and young migrants and refugees and have a responsibility to share appropriate information with U-reporters, as well as with the larger community.
DELIVERABLES & TIMELINE 
Under the guidance of the Youth and Adolescent Specialist, the U-Report Manager will:

support the adaptation and deployment of the U-Report platform on a number of digital platforms (Facebook, Twitter, TikTok etc), including the development and management of relevant partnerships (technical and programmatic).

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
Epidemics affect livelihoods, disrupt public service delivery and undermined economic growth and human rights. At the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is realizing, once again, the need to take urgent measures to be collectively and institutionally more resilient and better prepared for future health emergencies. For UNICEF, these crises highlight the need for the organization to strengthen its capacity as a reliable partner in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery efforts.
UNICEF has worked to respond to many types of health emergencies over the past decades and understands the complexities of this type of response. The organization’s unique attributes enable it to serve as an effective partner for national governments in developing and implementing multi-sectoral emergency responses. Arguably, UNICEF is the best placed agency to bring forth essential changes to epidemic preparedness and response through its proven expertise in key sectors (i.e. community health, primary health, immunization, WASH, Risk Communication and Community Engagement, Education, Supply systems, etc.) and steer global health out of exclusive bio-medical models.
Since September 2015, the Public Health Emergencies Program (previously known as Health Emergency Preparedness Initiative – HEPI), has led this work for the agency, while supporting the response to high-profile epidemics globally.
UNICEF has become a leading organization in PHE preparedness and response and partner with communities, governments (specially at the regional/district level), non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and other UN agencies. UNICEF provides leadership in the response through its cross-sectoral approach and programming expertise, including in:

Integrated Multidisciplinary Outbreak Analytics
Health & nutrition
Infection Prevention & Control and WASH
Risk Communication & Community engagement
Psycho-Social Support
Gender responsive programming
Supply & Logistics support

In addition to the PHE control response, UNICEF works equally hard to address the impacts of   the pandemic on continuity of essential social services that support children’s health and wellbeing such as education.
Purpose & Rationale
The recently completed internal UNICEF’s Humanitarian Review states the need for better internal understanding of UNICEF’s work on public health emergencies, and how the multiple sectors that contribute to the Public Health Emergency Program articulate themselves.
The 2020 UNICEF Core Commitments for Children include, for the first time, a section specific to Public Health Emergency crises, setting a unique opportunity to build a wider understanding of UNICEF’s key preparedness and response actions both internally and with our partners. 
Backed up by these initiatives and fueled by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the Public Health Emergencies team aims to take stock of UNICEF’s experience in preparedness and response and apply the lessons learned to prevent, prepare for and respond to future public health emergencies. To achieve that, the team will draft and disseminate several briefings and thought pieces, in collaboration with all PHE stakeholders at HQ and regional offices.
This consultancy will focus in supporting the PHE team in the writing of key technical documents and briefings, and facilitate internal discussion, to elaborate a body of knowledge on UNICEF’s role and experience in public health emergencies. The audience of such documentation is both internal (i.e. leadership briefings, coordination, technical assistance) and external (i.e. coordination with partners, fund-raising, technical advocacy).
 Terms of Reference / Deliverables
More specifically, the consultant will support the development of the following products:

Finalize draft PHE team guidance, briefs or scientific reviews
Compile a weekly/bi-weekly activity report for the PHE team

The consultant will regularly interact with the technical experts of the PHE team to receive the necessary technical references, documents and explanations upon which the items will be produced. Enough time should and will be allocated to the consultant to perform the items in accordance with agreed deadlines. It is possible that some products will be asked upon a very short notice (e.g.: last minute briefing notes asked by the senior management), in this case and in agreement with the head of the team, priority will be given to the completion of the concerned task. He/she will also collaborate with technical experts across sections and divisions to compile technical briefings and provide feedback for review.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, A fair chance
Protecting all children and ensuring special protection to the most disadvantaged children such as victims of violence, extreme poverty, all forms of exploitation, migration, and children with disabilities is a state’s responsibility. Universal and regional legal instruments set clear and attainable standards to protect children from all kind of violence and exploitation. In particular, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States to provide measures of protecting children against neglect, abuse and sexual exploitation, and to provide child victims with special help to recover and reintegrate into society.  The Gambian government has signed, ratified, and/or accepted a number of international instruments on child protection, in particular the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990), the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (2010),  the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (2000),  and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions on Child Labor, and the UN Protocol on Trafficking in Persons.  As a result, protecting children is an obligation for the Government of The Gambia.
The concept of “child protection” refers to preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and abuse against children – including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labor and harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage.  To reach this objective, UNICEF has chosen to work towards the building/strengthening of a national child protection system.  A national child protection system seeks to address the full spectrum of risk factors in the lives of all children and their families.  Along with partners, including governments, non-governmental organizations, civil society actors and the private sector, UNICEF promotes the strengthening of all components of national child protection systems - human resources, finances, laws, standards, governance, monitoring, evaluation and services provision. Depending on the country context, child protection systems may cut across part of the social welfare, education, health, and security sectors.  It is only through the concerted efforts of individuals and groups, adults as well as children, that child protection systems can become effective and sustainable.
The analysis of the child protection related situation is a very powerful tool in building or strengthening a system, and it provides essential elements to guide the development of child protection interventions.  In addition, it generates valuable information on the situation of children as well as the structures in place to address them and informs strategic planning and is a preliminary exercise to develop evidence-based recommendations.
The task requires the analysis of national and sub-national data, government’s strategies and plans for child protection and child rights; the  laws directly associated with children,  laws with provisions addressing issues facing children, research findings and reports of local civil societies, local and international NGOs; UNICEF and other UN agencies. The analysis should also take in account the voice of children who are currently or could be beneficiaries of the Child Protection Strategy and Costed work plan to reflect their concerns, needs and expectations.
 
How can you make a difference?
It is in this regard that the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare – with the support of UNICEF The Gambia – is seeking to carry out a Child Protection Situation Analysis to have an in-depth description of the extent to which children’s rights to protection are being fulfilled, and an analysis of the obstacles to, and enablers of, their realization.  The Child Protection Situation Analysis will also explore the structures in place to protect children, with a deep analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.
The Ministry in charge of Women, Children, and Social Welfare was instituted last year and recently the Children’s Directorate, responsible for all matters regarding the protection of children, has also been established within the Ministry. 
The Child Protection Situation Analysis will provide the Ministry with the information to design a Gambian Child Protection Strategy and Costed plan of action.
In particular, the Child Protection Situation Analysis should:

Identify child protection issues and their prevalence;
Identity root causes of child protection issues;
Identify groups of children who are particularly vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, neglect or other forms of violence
Identify and map the systems that are in place to protect children;

Collect and analyses data on strengths and gaps in the child protection system;
Document the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on protection rights of children in The Gambia. The findings of a Child Protection Situation Analysis will provide the foundation to:

Develop a national child protection strategy which guides child protection programming in the country;
Create stronger understanding of the child protection system among local programs and partners.
Support national and decentralized advocacy and planning to influence policies, strategies, budgets, and national laws;
Strengthen national and sub-national capacities to monitor the situation of children and women, principally regarding vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and how their specific rights are being met;
Engage development partners and donors - including UNICEF and the UN - in support of New Child Protection Strategy and Costed work plan.
Mainstream child protection matters in all relevant polices in The Gambia.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child,
Background and Justification
Making basic hygiene services accessible to all people in Lesotho is a top priority for the government and development partners. In addition to hygiene being an effective measure in reducing faecal-oral disease transmissions, the current COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical role hand hygiene plays in disease prevention and control. There is need to take immediate action on hand hygiene across all public and private settings to respond and control the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more importantly, there is a need to build on the current momentum to make hand hygiene a mainstay in public health interventions beyond the pandemic and create a culture of hand hygiene at all levels of society.
However, making hygiene available and accessible for all requires a multi-faceted, society-wide approach. First, this means an urgent need for improvement in access to sustainable hand hygiene services (handwashing facilities, regular water supply, soap or alcohol based handrubs., where handwashing with soap and water is not possible). Second, behavior change interventions should address the full range of drivers to support optimal hand hygiene behavior. And finally, components such as policy, coordination, regulation, human resource and financing which underpin hand hygiene services and behavior change need to be strengthened.
The available information shows that the hygiene situation in Lesotho is poor. Estimates show handwashing with soap and water is practiced by less than 20 per cent of the population, although the COVID-19 needs must have increased this proportion, but not yet quantified. Data on handwashing from health care facilities and learning institutions is not readily available. Hence, to operationalize the integration of hygiene in key strategic plans in the government, it is important to develop a hygiene strategy and costed implementation plan. This shall provide a clear road map for enhanced access to hygiene services by all in Lesotho. Therefore, UNICEF and Ministry of Health (MoH) through Environmental Health Department, in collaboration with other sector players, intend to recruit a highly qualified and experienced consultant to develop the hygiene strategy and costed implementation plan for Lesotho. 
 Purpose of the assignment:
The main purpose of this consultancy is to support MOH to develop National Hygiene Strategy and Costed Implementation Plan in Lesotho for 2021-2025 (for systems strengthening and capacity building) as well as financial plans. This strategy will provide specific guidance for implementation of the hardware and software components of hygiene in households, communities and open spaces, institutions, schools and health care facilities as well as the required financial allocations by the Government and other WASH sector partners. The implementation plan should be realistic and considering the conditions and situation in Lesotho and the urgency for hand hygiene for all caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
This Strategy should be comprehensive covering the various infrastructural as well as institutional strengthening and capacity development components that would further enable progress for results in hygiene. It should give very clear guidance on how hygiene can be promoted in different locations and contexts (urban and rural; in schools, health care facilities, households/communities, open spaces like markets, business establishments and other meeting places).
The strategy will establish the coordination and policy environment for the government, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), private sector and development partners to work together to achieve practical and timely national goals that are aligned with global standards and goals. It should provide guidance on coordination on hygiene at national, district and community levels, as well as across sectors (education, health, nutrition, WASH etc). The Ministry of Health will remain the lead Ministry and responsible for ownership of the strategy. This will also guide institutional capacity to absorb investments in a more effective manner to have standard approaches in achieving targets and to sustain the delivery of services through integrated approach. Further the strategy and implementation plan shall harmonize the working approach at the operational level.
Scope of Work
Goal and Objective: 
The main objective of this consultancy is to support MoH develop a comprehensive National Hygiene Strategy and costed implementation plan for Lesotho for 2021-2025 to accelerate access to basic hygiene services in Lesotho. The strategy and implementation plan will outline specific targets to be reached within the time frame.
The specific objectives expected:

Enhance the enabling environment for hygiene specifically in terms of

Establishing clear implementation guidelines and standards that are endorsed to be used nationwide and in different settings (households/community; schools and health care facilities) and locations (urban, rural)
Advocating for resource mobilization (from donors and other partners) and government allocations;
Stimulating development of market-based solutions on hygiene solutions innovative hygiene products and business solutions
Enhancing hygiene education by identifying suitable approaches for hygiene promotion

To provide recommendations for effective coordination (national, district; households, schools and health face facilities) and strategic positioning of hygiene in different sectors (Education, Health, Nutrition, WASH) in Lesotho, and relevant roles and responsibilities of relevant departments and authorities of government of Lesotho and partners. 
To develop communities of practice that brings together diverse stakeholders to discuss innovations and best practices on hygiene

Activities and Tasks

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
LOCATION/DURATION:
Duration:  10 months, part time (160 work days)
Location: Home-based or MENARO office based (Amman). Travel to select Country Offices/Amman, if feasible. 
BACKGROUND:
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is reported to be the most water scarce region in the world, with 11 of the world’s 17 most water stressed countries in the region. In MENA, nearly 9 out of 10 children live in areas of high or extremely high water stress.  While the MENA region has faced water challenges for thousands of years, numerous factors have combined to exacerbate water scarcity, including increased population, increased demand for water for agriculture, deteriorating infrastructure, high levels of non-revenue water, and urbanisation.
These factors are further compounded climate change due to increasing temperatures, reduced rain-fed growing periods, reduced surface water availability and contamination of fresh water reserves due to salinisation and pollution. According to the World Bank ‘Beyond Scarcity’ report, MENA has the greatest expected economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, estimated at 6 to 14 per cent of GDP.
 
UNICEF MENA Regional Office intends to support Country Offices in the region to increase UNICEF CO programming focus on the climate change crisis, including the impact on water scarcity, with the clear perception that this is a key priority limiting children’s health and their ability to reach their potential.  UNICEF aims to ensure that communities vulnerable to climate change are reached through the development and implementation of climate action targeted at resilience and adaptation activities for the benefit of children, both through upstream and downstream interventions.
This consultancy tasks outlined below are part of the larger climate change response efforts in the region.  The Climate Specialist will report to the WASH Regional Advisor and work within all UNICEF programming areas.
 
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this consultancy is to give additional support to programmes in country offices to identify the impact of climate change and water insecurity on their current and future programmes and to identify opportunities to integrate solutions into their programmes, as well as identifying opportunities for programmes to support the development of key national climate priorities and financing opportunities.

L'UNICEF travaille dans certains endroits les plus difficiles du monde pour atteindre les enfants les plus défavorisés. Pour sauver leur vie. Pour défendre leurs droits. Pour les aider à réaliser leur potentiel.
Dans 190 pays et territoires, nous travaillons pour chaque enfant, partout, chaque jour, pour construire un monde meilleur pour tous.
Et nous n'abandonnons jamais
Pour chaque enfant, un espoir
A Madagascar , de nombreux défis entravent encore la santé, le développement et la survie des enfants. Selon le MICS6-2018, le niveau de la mortalité infantile demeure élevé (40 décès pour mille naissances vivantes). Au-delà des pratiques liées à l’immunisation et la santé de la mère et de l’enfant, les pratiques liées à l’hygiène et à la nutrition affectent le bien-être de l’enfant et des mères.En effet, sur le plan de l’assainissement et de l’hygiène, liés à l’acces a l’eau potable, 57% de de la population malagasy n’a pas accès à une source d’eau améliorée et 4 personnes sur 5 boivent de l’eau contaminée tandis qu’encore une grande moitie de la population n’a pas accès à un service d’assainissement de base adéquat . Il apparait que ces problematiques liees a l’EAH tels que les problemes d’acces a l’eau potable, l’absence de conditionnement d’un environnement sain et la non utilisation des ressources alimentaires securisees ont des consequences nefastes directs sur la sante de l’enfant et de la mere (MICS6 2018).Ensuite, il y a l’insécurité alimentaire touchant les nourrisons, les jeunes enfants, les femmes enceintes et allaitantes. Ceci couvre autant l’accès à une alimentation saine et variée que l’adoption d’une alimentation adaptée et appropriée pour les femmes enceintes et allaitantes. Le MICS6-2018 révèle que :• A Madagascar, la situation par rapport au retard de croissance est critique car elle concerne 42% des enfants de moins de 5 ans. • La prévalence de l'émancipation dans le pays est précaire avec un taux global de 6% incluant 1% de cas sévères. Les enfants âgés de 12 à 17 mois sont les plus vulnérables, avec une prévalence de 9%.• Au niveau national, parmi les enfants âgés de 6-23 mois, à peine 1 enfant sur 4 bénéficie d’une diversité minimale de l’alimentation.• Les enfants âgés de 6-23 mois des ménages les plus pauvres sont ceux qui bénéficient le moins d’une diversité minimale de l’alimentation en comparaison aux enfants des ménages les plus riches (56%).Face à ceci, l'UNICEF reconnaît que le développement du comportement et la communication pour le changement social sont l'une des composantes programmatiques transversales importantes dans la réalisation des résultats pour les enfants et les adolescents. En effet, la réalisation de ces résultats dépend fortement de l’adoption des gestes favorables par les parents et responsables d’enfant, sous condition de changements dans les normes, les attitudes et le comportement des individus, des familles et des communautés.

For every child, Health and HIV/AIDS
Zambia is a lower-middle-income country and one of the most politically stable democracies in Africa, with an estimated population of 16.4 million in 2017, of which 58 per cent is rural and 42 per cent urban.  The population is quite youthful, with children representing 53 per cent – a total of 8.6 million. This large, young population represents an opportunity for economic development, but also presents challenges due to the demand for social services and employment. Despite Zambia’s classification as a lower-middle income country by the World Bank in 2011 and a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $1,300 in 2017, 54.5 per cent of the population still live below the poverty line. Inequality remains high, with three quarters of those in rural areas living in poverty – as compared to one quarter in urban areas.
UNICEF’s Country Programme 2016-2021 focuses on practical ways to realize the rights of children. UNICEF's work spans seven areas – health & HIV/AIDS; nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); education; child protection; and social policy. The programme's aim is that Zambian children, especially the most disadvantaged children and families, have access to and benefit from quality social services, knowledge and opportunities, and thereby have a fair chance in life. https://unicef.sharepoint.com/sites/ZMB/SitePages/About-us(1).aspx

UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
General Assembly Resolution A/RES/74/133 on the promotion and protection of the rights of children adopted on 18 December 2019 requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-six session (2021) a comprehensive report on the rights of the child containing information on the status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and on the issues addressed in the resolution, with a focus on the rights of the child and the Sustainable Development Goals.   
UNICEF is the lead agency tasked with drafting and compiling the report, in consultation with other UN agencies, departments, funds and programmes.  The drafting process is conducted in close collaboration with OHCHR, who will be reviewing and submitting the report to the Executive Office of the Secretary General. Key contributions will include submissions by Member States, UN entities, and civil society organizations.
This year’s report provides an important opportunity for UNICEF and key partners to prominently feature children’s rights in the context of the 2030 Agenda and its pledge of Leaving No One Behind, and focus in particular on efforts applied to 1) ensure that a child-rights approach is central to the implementation of the SDGs, and 2) overcome the SDG implementation gaps and barriers affecting child rights realization, looking for examples at steps taken to:

Strengthen accountability for children’s rights.
Tackle all forms of discrimination against children including intersecting and overlapping forms of discrimination.
Reach children who are left behind or at risk of being further left behind.
Ensure children’s meaningful participation in matters that affect them.

For every child, Hope
Since 2016, UNICEF has made preparedness planning mandatory and adopted new and more systemic ways of working through the UNICEF Procedure on Preparedness for Emergency Response and the online Emergency Preparedness Platform (EPP). Preparedness, once only an issue for specialists, increasingly features in the daily work of more staff across more functions and offices. The EPP is central to this new preparedness architecture. Launched in January 2018, this practical tool is enabling country offices (COs) – in concert with regional offices (ROs) and headquarters (HQ) - to systematically analyse risks, develop response plans and identify capacity gaps, from where they launch specific steps to strengthen their preparedness. To date, all COs have uploaded their preparedness plans to the platform. The EPP and the new preparedness architecture have already led to real improvements in COs’ preparedness, including the following: many COs have produced response plans that can be quickly used at the onset of emergencies, signed stand-by agreements with partners, established long-term agreements with vendors for supplies and logistics services, and strengthened sectoral coordination agreements with interagency partners and governments.
The EPP platform was recently upgraded to support COs in developing more impactful preparedness plans and to promote their readiness to quickly launch humanitarian responses at the onset of emergencies. The new version introduces a set of preparedness benchmarks for minimum preparedness standards (depending on the country risk level) and places greater emphasis on standing response capacity, preparedness budgets and alignment with interagency and local government planning – all essential elements of UNICEF emergency preparedness.
Despite important progress, the quality of preparedness and contingency plans on the EPP needs further improvement, with some plans requiring significant work. Quality assurance of preparedness plans remains a key responsibility of UNICEF staff (specialists, focal points, others) at country, regional and HQ levels.
In close coordination with ROs, the Office of Emergency Programmes (EMOPS) supports quality reviews of EPP plans, prioritizing high and medium risk countries, as well as countries identified as high priority for emergency preparedness through a horizon scan process. Reviews assess the quality of plans and the extent to which minimum preparedness standards are met. The reviews result in qualitative feedback aimed at improving the quality of the EPP plans and provide high-level recommendations for addressing preparedness gaps. In 2021 and beyond, EMOPS seeks to intensify and improve the quality review process for preparedness/contingency plans with the purpose of strengthening the overall quality of EPP plans, and ultimately enhancing UNICEF’s preparedness capacity.
How can you make a difference?
Scope of Work: 
The consultant will work closely with EMOPS’s Risk Analysis and Preparedness Section to assess the quality of EPP plans developed by select country offices and provide feedback through quality assurance (analysis by the consultant alone) and spot checks (coordinated with other HQ divisions and ROs) in the EPP.
Planning:
Develop a work plan and methodology to meet the objectives of the consultancy.
Quality Reviews:

Assess the quality of selected EPP plans of high and medium risk countries, as well as countries identified as high priority for emergency preparedness through a monthly horizon scan process, and provide feedback to EMOPS, ROs and COs, as appropriate.
Revise and update the EPP Quality Assurance checklist in line with the recently upgraded EPP platform.
Support HQ spot checks of EPP plans coordinated by EMOPS with HQ Divisions and ROs, produce qualitative feedback, and coordinate the dissemination of feedback to ROs and COs, as appropriate.
Support the improvement of EPP user instructional materials/help files in line with the recently upgraded EPP platform.
Document good practices, lessons learned and areas for improvement in relation to the EPP/preparedness planning.

For every child, Commitment...
Millions of people all over the world support UNICEF and our cause. They raise money, they campaign and in some countries they volunteer to help children in myriad ways. There is an opportunity to build on this force for good and go to another level of engagement with a committed group of volunteer supporters. Our aim is to build a UNICEF membership cadre of millions who champion the change we need through their individual and collective commitment. A volunteer force would vastly extend UNICEF’s reach and help broaden and transform UNICEF itself.  
Background:
Volunteering enables young people to envision and reclaim their place in society. There's a multiplying force of volunteerism: as young volunteers build self-awareness, self-esteem and confidence, they enact change in their communities and impart skills to others while acquiring skills themselves. Learning by doing, volunteers become proficient in communication, problem-solving, organizing, and planning and benefit from a stronger start to their employment journeys. By mobilising young people to volunteer, we expand our reach, access, and trust with communities, strengthen our ability to deliver on programme and advocacy goals, and provide young people with empowering and upskilling experiences— moving closer to a world in which young people are changemakers shaping more just and equitable outcomes
 Volunteers may contribute their time and experience through:  

Service activities (from building a playground, helping with language learning, to participating in emergency response) in local communities and attending signature events;  
Organizing events and volunteer activities;  
Speaking about issues for children in their communities;  
Advocacy with governments and the private sector; and  
Fundraising to support children.   

As volunteers periodically take action in support of children, and come to identify with UNICEF, they will not only contribute to their communities but also contribute energy and advice to UNICEF.  
About us
We are a small team working within UNICEF/Generation Unlimited to support the skills, experience, creativity, and ideas of colleagues, and to help them create a global volunteer force of millions who take action for children.
Our team is gathering and consolidating existing tools and resources; generating the additional systems and tools that colleagues need; fostering a vibrant community of practice among colleagues working with volunteers; and offering research, strategic, and execution support to country teams as they launch and/or scale volunteer activities.
Most of the things we make will be accessible to UNICEF's 135 country offices and 30+ National Committees. We will work with countries to create dynamic volunteer initiatives that can model ways of working and inspire colleagues across the organization.
How can you make a difference?

For every child, health
 BACKGROUND 
The mission and goal of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) program in Guinea-Bissau is to contribute to the overall realization of the National Health Development Plan (PNDS) by reducing morbidity, mortality and disability due to vaccine preventable diseases and to ensure all children and high-risk group are fully vaccinated with high quality and effective vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases as per national and global standards. To achieve these goals, routine immunization services for children and pregnant women are provided through static, outreach and mobile sites and occasional special acceleration campaigns.
Immunization is the most widely accessed and successful child health intervention in use today in Guinea Bissau. But immunization coverage has stagnated at 88% of DPT3 over the last five years (WUENIC 2019), which is probably related to the general instability context resulting in the erosion of public services and systems. Also, these relative high rates mask inequities at the subnational level. At subnational level, 3 out of 11 regions has the DTP3 coverage less than 80 per cent in 2020. Around 8,000 children remained unvaccinated in Guinea-Bissau during 2019, more in 2020 with the COVID-19 context. More than 60% of those unvaccinated children are living in urban area, principally in the capital Bissau.
The study on equity in immunization conducted in 2017 showed that the major bottlenecks to immunization are: geographical access; continuity in use; quality of services, except for Bissau where the issues are quite different, more related to human resources capacity and economic activities of mothers. The study also helped identify underserved communities in each region for which specific efforts must be undertaken to reach every child. Major challenges remain in terms of insufficient allocation of human resources, coordination, outreach strategies, cold chain management and data collection.
Strategies to reach unvaccinated children have been developed and are being implemented.
To improve the amount, quality and use of available immunization data, Gavi launched and is implemented with country partners a strategic focus area for data that address three key areas:

Immunization delivery, coverage and equity: strengthening the quality of immunization coverage data to help address bottlenecks.
Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance: helping countries to strengthen their surveillance systems and use disease data to target and improve immunization programmes. VPD surveillance systems are also a vital part of ensuring global health security and outbreak preparedness.
Vaccine safety surveillance and response: establishing and improving data systems to detect adverse events and implement effective response and communication strategies.

Through their assistance, Vaccine Alliance partners are supporting new ways to use data to inform immunization programmes. This includes the production of various immunization coverage and equity analyses as well as targeted support for data improvement plans.
UNICEF is at the forefront of supporting the MOH in immunization data management, ensuring that all children are equitably reached, and would like to recruit three experienced national consultants to provide a technical insight to the country’s immunization team at national and regional level in this area, especially targeting the regions with low coverage.

 BACKGROUND 
Globally, immunization is the most widely accessed and successful child health intervention in use today. However, On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later, on 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of pneumonia. To date, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. The Communication for Development program is at the forefront of UNICEF's emergency response.
The COVAX Facility, one of three key pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is a global collaboration co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and WHO to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access globally. With over 300 COVID-19 vaccine candidates being monitored in varying stages of development and 25 vaccines in clinical evaluation, it is possible that a many vaccine candidate may achieve emergency use approval in 2021.
Most health information system in Guinea-Bissau rely on traditional methods and paper or paper-electronic hybrid systems for measuring vaccination coverage, which can result in delayed information gathering for outbreak response. Extracting from paper-based records and transferring it to electronic records is time consuming and leads to delays in the availability of information, especially during outbreaks. Administrative coverage data are commonly used to assess coverage of mass vaccination campaigns.
An effective national implementation of COVID-19 vaccination will depend on the ability to access, receive and share information rapidly between managers and staff at all levels. To enable comprehensive decision-making, information from different data sources linked to COVID-19 such as local epidemiology, vaccination preparedness, performance and coverage monitoring, vaccine and supply management, vaccine safety and immunization waste management should be collected, analyzed and disseminated. For most COVID-19 vaccine products, two doses of vaccine likely separated by 21 or 28 days, will be needed. Because different COVID-19 vaccine products will not be interchangeable, a vaccine recipient’s second dose must be from the same manufacturer as their first dose. The real-time monitoring of uptake, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines would benefit from use of electronic information platforms;
The UNICEF is supporting the overall COVID-19 vaccination roll-out across the country and looking for providing support to advance its planning horizons to introduce this new vaccine and identify key components (including information systems and monitoring) to strengthen as preparation for vaccination against this pandemic. Moreover, building and leveraging the COVID-19 vaccination introduction.

Globally, immunization is the most widely accessed and successful child health intervention in use today. However, On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later, on 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of pneumonia.

With over 300 COVID-19 vaccine candidates being monitored in varying stages of development and 25 vaccines in clinical evaluation, it is possible that a many vaccine candidate may achieve emergency use approval in 2021. In preparation for this, effective assessment of communities’ and Health workers’ knowledge, behavior, attitude, and practice for this new vaccine and the development of evidence-based demand generation strategies is capital.
Hence, UNICEF Guinea-Bissau Office is seeking assistance in the form of a consultancy with a duration of 6 months to support in developing an evidence-based Demand Generation and Communication Plan. The plan should include advocacy, communications, social mobilization, risk and safety communications, community engagement, and training to generate confidence, acceptance, and demand for COVID-19 vaccines uptake by the priority target population (Front Line Workers, elderly/adults with comorbidities and/or other locally relevant risk factors). The plan should also include crisis communications preparedness planning.
 OBJECTIVE 
The overall objective of this consultancy is to ensure that public acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the country is adequate. In this regard the consultant is expected to understand key drivers of immunization demand among both Front-Line Workers and the general population, to successfully promote and sustain the desired behaviour based on evidence. This should be done through an initial assessment and analysis for key demand-related drivers including risk perception and vaccine hesitancy, documentation of demand generation interventions and the establishment of a social listening and rumour management platform to inform crisis communication activities.
How can you make a difference?

For every child, care 
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does - in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life - in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions - her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens - addressing inequity - not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also accelerating the equitable development of nations to attain SDG.
 
How can you make a difference?
You will provide leadership and support to the national and subnational WASH coordination structures within the Humanitarian Cluster Approach. To fulfill this function, you will secure the overall cluster coordination of child WASH responses. 
Moreover, you will support the development of a strategy to facilitate transitioning of WASH cluster to sector.  The proposed transitioning should also reflect advocacy for government to take over leadership of the coordination, and the information management with technical support from UNICEF and other WASH partners on capacity building and filling the gap for any resources and technical needs.
The WASH Cluster Coordinator plays the role of a facilitator of the coordination process at Iraq national and sub-national levels.  The success of the WASH Cluster will be dependent on the level of participation and contributions that the Cluster Coordinator can generate from the various WASH actors to strengthen the response and achieve greater results.

Background and Project Description
The Spotlight Initiative is a global partnership between the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in support of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. It was launched in September 2017 by the UN Secretary-General and the EU High Representative and Vice President (HRVP). This Initiative provides a model for partnerships with donors, civil society, and the UN to deliver on the SDGs in a comprehensive manner leveraging comparative expertise. SDG 5 and the achievement of gender equality are placed at the centre of efforts (alongside Goal 16) with the aim to provide an enabling environment for the implementation of all goals. Within the UN, the Initiative will operationalize the UN development system reforms and model a new way of delivering on the SDGs in an integrated way, leveraging collaborative advantages.
In Guyana, the Spotlight Initiative aims to address the root causes of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) with an emphasis on the prevention of family violence which includes sexual and gender-based violence, intimate partner violence and school-based violence.  Therefore, under the pillar related to “institutional strengthening”, it is recognised that longer-term plans of action (and “visioning”) are needed for documented sector plans which are actionable and monitored. These actions will help address, among other things, the power imbalance and gender equality as a foundation for the work on Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG), siloed approaches, and matters of accountability within and between sectors. It will provide institutions with key tools to allow for increased “decentralized” responses in the sectors and in the local governance system to strengthen access to prevention and response services (including access to justice and social support). 
The products of this consultancy will become a critical reference point(s) for the work related to the gender-responsive budgeting into government programmes and mechanisms for the systematic analysis of the impact of policies on EVAWG. It is also expected that the products of this consultancy will assist in ensuring task forces and reporting mechanisms are strengthened to support the coordination, monitoring, accountability and oversight of work on family violence.
FUNCTIONS/DUTIES TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONSULTANTS
 
Under the direct supervision of the UNICEF and with support from UN Women and MoHSSS, the consultant is expected to undertake the following tasks:
• Mapping of CSOs  (this includes presenting a list of the selected CSOs and develop a work plan for strengthening and empowering them to carry out activities under pillar 6 and work within Spotlight and beyond with approval of the Ministry of Human Services and Social Security (MoHSSS) in Guyana• Conduct Training Needs Assessment •  Training and Capacity Building of CSOs• Engage to implement project activities. • Work closely with the selected CSOs to provide tools and techniques to ensure that they are well equipped to lead and implement the activities. • Monitor and evaluate their acquired skills and use of resources.
 
The consultant must also:
- Identify registered and non-registered CSOs within Guyana which work with the identified underserved communities (as per Spotlight target) and other communities on EVAW.- Convene meetings with the identified CSOs to gain insight into their operations and undertakings - Conduct an analysis of the CSOs in relation to their suitability and capacity to engage in activities under pillar 6 such as developing new forms of social activism, and accountability frameworks) and other work on Ending Violence; identifying strengths and weaknesses, challenges and opportunities.  
Furthermore, the consultant will be expected to:
• Provide biweekly updates as it relates to the achievement of consultancy objectives. • Demonstrate management and leadership skills. • Demonstrate the ability to communicate comprehensively at all levels.• Be available to travel to the regions of Guyana, including remote areas.• Have a working knowledge of the local CSOs and non-governmental landscape in Guyana.• Have a knowledge of gender-based violence and family violence issues.• Have good inter-personal, networking, partnership and team-building skills.• Be fluent in written and spoken English.

Dans 190 pays et territoires, nous travaillons pour chaque enfant, partout, chaque jour, afin de construire un monde meilleur pour tous.
 
Et nous n'abandonnons jamais.
 
Pour chaque enfant, la santé
 
But de la consultation :
 
Le Congo a réalisé des progrès considérables dans la lutte contre la poliomyélite depuis 1988 date de lancement par l’Assemblée mondiale de la santé de l’Initiative mondiale pour l’éradication de la poliomyélite (IEP) pour laquelle le Congo est partie prenante.
 Aucun cas de poliovirus sauvage (PVS) n’a été rapporté au Congo depuis la fin de la dernière épidémie de 2010. Cependant, le risque d’une nouvelle importation du PVS des pays voisins est présent du fait de la baisse de performance du système de surveillance et de la faible couverture vaccinale en routine.
Malgré la mise en œuvre de cette activité en 2019 des journées locales de vaccination contre la poliomyélite sur recommandation du bureau régional de l’OMS Afrique, la faiblesse de notre système de surveillance et la résurgence des cas de polio virus dérivés de vaccin détectés en RDC, place les départements riverains de notre pays en possible situation d’importation des cas de PVDV.  L’analyse de risque conduite au Congo a retenu trois départements (Likouala, Pool et Pointe Noire) et trois districts sanitaires (Mossaka Loukoléla, Makotipoko et Ile Mbamou).
Dans ce contexte particulier, l’intensification de la recherche des cas suspects de polio ont permis de détecter un cas dans le Kouilou.
Cette nouvelle donne oblige le pays à organiser la riposte très rapidement. La riposte au cas de Kouilou sur orientation du niveau global se fera avec le Novel Vaccin Poliomyélite Oral 2 (nVPO2). Le Congo à l’instar du Liberia sera un des premiers pays à utiliser le nVPO2.
L’introduction de ce nouveau vaccin se fera également dans un contexte déjà marqué par la pandémie de COVID-19. Bien que le Congo ait été jusque-là relativement épargné par la pandémie, celle-ci a affecté les activités de santé, y compris de vaccination.
 
C’est dans ce contexte que s’inscrit la présente consultation.
 
Le consultant en charge de la logistique de la chaine de froid et de la logistique vaccinale est chargé d'appuyer les départements du Congo à planifier, utiliser, gérer les stocks, éliminer (si nécessaire) et monitorer tous les vaccins utilisés lors des campagnes de lutte contre les épidémies de polio et accompagner le pays dans toutes les étapes pour l’introduction du nVPO2.

BACKGROUND 
On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later, on 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of the pneumonia. To date the corona virus (COVID-19) has spread to over 150 countries, including over 10 in East and southern Africa. The Communication for Development programme is at the forefront of UNICEF emergency response.
The COVAX Facility, one of three key pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is a global collaboration co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access globally. With over 300 COVID-19 vaccine candidates being monitored in varying stages of development and 25 vaccines in clinical evaluation, it is possible that a vaccine candidate may achieve emergency use approval in 2020. In preparation for this, effective assessment of communities and Health workers knowledge, behaviour, attitude and practice for this new vaccine and the development of evidence-based demand generation strategies is capital.
Hence, UNICEF Lesotho Office, is seeking assistance in the form of a consultancy equivalent to 10 months To provide technical support to Ministry of Health and partners to support Health Education Department and RCCE to develop and implement evidence based advocacy, communication and social mobilization to support the introduction of COVID 19 vaccine in the country, including the preparedness and response plan for crisis communication.
JUSTIFICATION
UNICEF is supporting the Government of Lesotho through the Ministry of Health to coordinate and develop evidenced based communication strategies for effective covid-19 response and vaccine introduction and roll-out plans. As the assignment requires intensive dedicated work, full-time consultants will be needed to support the quick roll out of COVID 19 vaccine in the first wave and beyond. This capacity staff capacity surge is needed to support the UNICEF Lesotho Communication team which is providing support to the EPI and HED units of Ministry of Health. Therefore, UNICEF is looking to recruit a contractor to provide rapid support to MoH and partners on/demand generation for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.

In the past six years more than 10,000 children were recruited and used by various parties in MENA. This includes children recruited and used in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Today, children continue to both join and exit armed forces and armed groups in the MENA region. For those children who leave armed actors they face massive legal, social and political challenges to reintegrate back into their communities and are therefore in need of reintegration support to ensure a safe and sustainable return to civilian life.

UNICEF’s child protection programmes also target children who are uniquely vulnerable to these abuses, such as when living without parental care, in conflict with the law and in armed conflict.

One of the critical goals of UNICEF for child survival and development is to improve child nutrition and prevent associated mortality and morbidity. Although significant progress has been made, there are still 149 million children under 5 with stunting and almost 50 million with wasting.
To address this, UNICEF has launched a new nutrition strategy (2020-2030) to achieve a vision of a world where all children, adolescents and women realize their right to nutrition. The strategy has six results areas, including Results Area 5 on Maternal and Child Nutrition in Humanitarian action, which encompasses UNICEF’s nutrition programming in emergencies. Results Area 5 is guided by UNICEF’s Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and UNICEF’s commitments as Cluster Lead Agency for Nutrition.
Knowledge for maternal and child nutrition is one of the strategy’s programming priorities. UNICEF advocates for and supports evidence-informed nutrition policies, strategies, programmes and financing. This involves conducting studies, research and evaluations to support evidence-informed policies and programming and strengthening mechanisms to share and exchange knowledge.

Background and Context

Montenegro has an upper-middle-income economy and is a candidate for accession to the European Union (EU). This process is a national priority and a major driver of reforms for human and children’s rights.
Observance of human and child rights represents an important part of the enlargement policy for Montenegro and an essential value of the European Union. Thus, the country has undertaken relevant measures to implement institutional, legislative and administrative reforms to align its policies with those internationally recognized and make sure that the rights and needs of each individual child are observed and protected in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. However, not all children have benefitted equally and there are still significant regional and urban/rural inequalities to be addressed, as well as divergences between socioeconomic quintiles, and deprivations based on discrimination.
UNICEF Montenegro Country Programme (2017-2021) is aligned with the Government of Montenegro’s EU accession priorities, the National Strategy on Sustainable Development until 2030 and the Integrated UN Programme in Montenegro  (UNDAF, 2017-2021). The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favouritism.
Montenegro is a parliamentary democracy, with a single-chamber legislature. The Parliament adopts the Constitution, passes laws, approves the State budget and elects the Prime Minister. There are 81 seats in the Parliament. Through the election process, citizens transfer their sovereignty to their representatives, members of the Parliament, who strive to propose and pass laws which serve the best interests of each citizen. In doing so, the Parliament of Montenegro strives to use its convening power to shed light on various issues and align its functioning with the needs of various social strata. In the past, “Women’s” Parliament, “Children’s Parliament”, democracy workshops for children, etc. were organized. Thus, the Parliament continues to evolve its functioning, by adopting comparative practices and innovative approaches to engagement and interaction with the citizens. In 2021, the occasion of Days of Parliamentarism, normally celebrated toward the end of October, will give young people an insight into the processes of the legislature. To achieve this, simulation sessions of the Parliament will be organized, to empower adolescent boys and girls to have their rights protected and promoted.

Purpose and Objective

The objectives of the assignment are to enable the Parliament of Montenegro staff to engage adolescents and youth in its functioning, by relying on its own resources. Specifically, the intention is to enrich outreach to adolescent boys and girls through parliamentary simulation education programmes and enable the participants in simulation to get to know the parliamentary institutional structure and decision-making process and experience the democratic process of legislative procedures through active participation and practical experience. The work will be carried out in close cooperation with the team of the Education Centre of the Parliament of Montenegro. Overall, through the simulation the participants will: develop their skills of self-expression and public speaking/debate and negotiation skills; develop a sense of the parliamentary work and have hands-on experience in the Parliament of Montenegro and the people behind it; understand democratic processes and parliamentary system and gain further knowledge on how the society functions; promote youth activism and participation and awareness about the protection and promotion of child rights, enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Methodology and Technical Approach

Engagement of adolescents in this activity will be done through the formal education system. A detailed parliamentary simulation programme with methodology and materials for high school teachers and students will be designed, as well as training for the staff of the Education Centre will be provided. The Consultant is expected to support the staff of the Education Centre in designing the programme and prepare materials for parliamentary simulation, as well as provide necessary training for the staff of the Education Centre. Therefore, this is envisaged as a training-of-trainers format, to ensure that capacities remain with the Education Centre team, thus ensuring sustainability.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Protection
Sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) in humanitarian crises are global problems. They violate not only the physical integrity and security of the individual victims but also their dignity and self-worth. They are a consequence of unequal power relationships; a dynamic that is often exacerbated during humanitarian crises, which are often characterized by widespread and systematic violence, mass displacement, and the breakdown in traditional family structures and social, legal, governance and value systems.  Women and children constitute the overwhelming majority of victims of SEA
The economic and social inequalities affecting women and children, in particular, put them at higher risk of exploitation by those in positions of power. Sexual exploitation and abuse, in humanitarian crises and elsewhere, reflect a variety of failures or omissions attributable to a range of responsible actors and institutions. They represent a failure to uphold basic rights to protection. In institutional terms, sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian staff represents a failure on the part of humanitarian agencies, whose stated role is to provide protection and care, deeply undermining the implicit public trust placed in humanitarian actors. The potential for SEA against women and children affected by conflict and crisis across the Middle East and North Africa region is extremely high and thus requires specialized, dedicated support to Country Offices.
The UN recognizes its role and responsibility, in fulfilling its mandate, to guard or protect vulnerable persons from sexual and other exploitation and abuse and to address such violations appropriately in its work.  The UN aims at ensuring that its staff and implementing partners do not abuse their power and influence to exploit and harm others. Child safeguarding, including Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), is an issue at the core of our business. As a humanitarian agency dedicated to child rights, we consider all cases of sexual exploitation and abuse extremely seriously and take all steps necessary to safeguard children within our operations. The UN has a zero-tolerance policy towards SEA.
The Syria inter-agency Network for the Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SIAN-PSEA) was revitalized in 2018. The Network operates under the auspices of the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC), who has the ultimate responsibility on inter‐agency PSEA, and the Chairpersonship of the UNICEF and UNHCR’s Representatives to ensure system-wide accountability, prevent and respond to SEA and protect vulnerable persons from such violations in the course of implementing UN programmes.

UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to protect the rights of every child. UNICEF has spent 70 years working to improve the lives of children and their families. Defending children's rights throughout their lives requires a global presence, aiming to produce results and understand their effects. UNICEF believes all children have a right to survive, thrive, and fulfill their potential – to the benefit of a better world. 
For every child, Health.
With over 850 indigenous languages and one of the most ethnically diverse populations, widespread poverty, and gender inequality make it hard for many children to realize their rights. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), UNICEF’s works effectively both ‘upstream’ (with governments) and ‘downstream’ (at the grassroots level) to carry out its mission through a programme of cooperation jointly developed with the government guides our work in the country.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Since then, a few candidate vaccines have been developed and are already been deployed in several countries worldwide. It is expected that the COVID-19 vaccine will be introduced in PNG in the second quarter of 2021.  It is always challenging to introduce a new vaccine; the process can have a significant impact – both positive and negative. The country’s health system, the general public and the new target populations e.g. front-line service providers must be well prepared to ensure the desired acceptance and uptake of the vaccine. The introduction of the new COVID-19 vaccine will come with similar challenges but it is key to the successful reduction of transmission and containment of the pandemic. There is also the need to respond to the recurring challenge of rumours and misinformation about vaccines among the community and in this regard, the COVID-19 vaccine. Considering the age groups prioritized and possible adverse events by the new vaccine, there is need for adequate capacity and preparedness in the demand creation and communication around the vaccine.

Duration: 138 working days over a period of 11.5 months
 
About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The Education Section based in New York supports UNICEF’s commitment to advancing access, participation and relevant learning outcomes for marginalized children in its policy leadership and support to countries for excellence in programming.  Guided by the vision in the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018-2030), Goal 2 “Every child learns”, the Education Section leads global efforts for development of evidence-based policy guidance, standard setting and programme approaches to pre-primary education. Under its Education Strategy (2019-2030), UNICEF has identified early childhood education (ECE) as one of its priority areas and strategic shifts to address the global learning crisis at its roots. Furthermore, UNICEF is scaling up its investment in pre-primary education with a decisive commitment to allocate 10% of its education resources to catalyze ECE results. UNICEF is committed to elevating the priority and status of pre-primary education by ensuring that it is systematically integrated in Education Sector Planning processes.
As part of these efforts, UNICEF Education Section was awarded a Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (KIX) grant to scale up an innovative approach and global toolkit to in-country capacity development for enhancing ECE analysis, planning and implementation (called the “BELDS approach”). This KIX project aims to support the effective and strategic integration of the pre-primary sub-sector within Education Sector Planning processes in five Global Partnership for Education (GPE) member countries, while generating and mobilizing global knowledge on ECE policy and practice through the expansion and launch of a comprehensive global e-toolkit (the “ECE Accelerator: Analysis and Planning Toolkit”) meant to support the scale up of quality ECE across all GPE member countries. UNICEF leads on this project, with its partners World Bank and Early Childhood Development Action Network (ECDAN).
Purpose
The purpose of this consultancy is to contribute to the effective and efficient implementation of the work plan under the KIX project, which involves 3 main streams of work:

Stream 3: Ongoing knowledge generation, mobilization and sharing.

There are few greater challenges faced by the global community than the learning crisis.  By 2030, nearly half of the world’s young people will be failing to learn.  This ticking time-bomb for global development will undermine the achievement of all of the Sustainable Development Goals, and demands urgent global action.
In response, the Education Commission (chaired by Gordon Brown, former UK Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy for Global Education) and the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment (chaired by Sir Ronald Cohen) have come together to create the Education Outcomes Fund (EOF), an initiative to improve the education of 10 million children and young people. EOF will support governments over the next decade to improve outcomes in education and youth employment by paying for results delivered by innovative NGOs and social entrepreneurs. EOF will use several innovative finance instruments including development impact bonds (DIBs) and other Results-Based Financing mechanisms to achieve this mission.
The fund will support improvements in the quality of education and skills programs, and seek to ensure that no child or young person is left behind, with a special focus on underserved populations including the hardest to reach rural populations, girls, children with disabilities, and refugees.  It will measure (and pay for) what matters – both core skills like literacy and numeracy, but also critical 21st Century skills such as socio-emotional skills, ICT skills, and other broader fundamentals of a quality education.  It will help close the persistent gap between the skills needed by employers, and those attained by today’s youth by paying for employment and retention outcomes. 
For all the above, EOF will pay almost entirely on the basis of the results achieved, ensuring that taxpayer-funded domestic resources, aid, and philanthropic funds are only used to pay for what works.
This is a game-changing way to finance results in education.  It is more than just a fund – it is a powerful new set of partnerships and way of working.  Rather than fragmented spending on inputs and activities, it aligns the whole system around a common, agreed set of outcomes.  Rather than stifling NGOs with restricted funding, EOF empowers and supports them to innovate, adapt, and find context-specific solutions.  And rather than being funded on the basis of emotional appeals about their impact, providers and investors will be rewarded based on independently verified results.  This radical transparency will ensure that EOF, government policy makers and the broader donor community can systematically shift funds towards scaling programs that demonstrate the best results and value for money.
We believe this is the early stages of a much larger movement.  As the development sector continues to shift away from traditional, activity-based funding towards results-based approaches, there is growing interest in outcomes funds and impact bonds, that go beyond outputs (the focus of most results-based aid to date) to reward outcomes. Shifting risk to the private sector, crowding in private capital and harnessing the capacity and capability of non-state actors has huge potential to achieve better outcomes and better value for money. 
We hope you will join us on this exciting journey to launch programs as part of the first large scale outcomes funds for development, in support of achieving inclusive and quality education for all.

How can you make a difference?
Background
Ending preventable maternal and perinatal mortality is a global priority under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The aim is to reduce the average global Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and neonatal mortality to at least 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. The current health sector development plan (2016-2020) targets are to reduce MMR from 336 to 219/100,000 live births and for institutional MMR from 92 to 60/100,000 between 2020 and 2025 has been set in the revised plan. As of 2018/2019, West Nile subregion had an institutional MMR of 99.1/100,000 live births.
Uganda achieved a remarkable progress in improving maternal new-born and child health indicators over the past decade. In 2019, the Annual Health Sector Report (2018/19) showed that 42 and 62 per cent of pregnant mothers attended 4th Antenatal care (ANC) visits and delivered in Health Facilities compared to 38 and 60 percent in 2017/2018 respectively. These improvements in coverage indicators have translated into some reductions in maternal mortality. The number of maternal deaths among 100,000 health facility deliveries reduced by 12% to 92 per 100,000 facility deliveries in 2018/19 from 104 per 100,000 in 2017/18. This achievement is beyond the target of 102 per 100,000 facility deliveries for FY 2018/19 however the main causes of mortality remain the same. Obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths accounting for 46% of all the maternal deaths reported, followed by hypertensive disorders (11%) and puerperal sepsis (6%). Abortion related complications accounted for 5% of maternal deaths.
Specifically, post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) accounted for 39% of all deaths and 84% of all cases (206) of obstetric hemorrhage with ruptured uterus due to obstructed labor estimated at (34%), uterine atony (19%), and rupture of previous scar (16%). Hemorrhage after Caesarean section accounted for 4% of maternal deaths. PPH has therefore been a key area of focus of the Safe motherhood technical working group and specific guidelines are under development and there is interest in addressing the other major causes; pregnancy induced hypertension, sepsis and complications of abortion.
While there is paucity of data on near-misses in developing countries, a BMJ study estimates that “for every maternal death, there are nine women who develop severe maternal ‘near-miss’ morbidity: Many of these women will need critical  and the WHO near miss approach recognizes that women who survive life-threatening conditions arising from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth have many common aspects with those who die of such complications.
UNICEF in partnership with the MOH, district local governments and implementing partners such as  Baylor, Intra-health and AVSI, are working to strengthen the capacity of the districts to deliver an integrated package of Reproductive, Maternal, New-born, Child and Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAHN) services inclusive of HIV, and Nutrition using a Health System Strengthening approach and Quality Improvement (QI) approaches. Additional efforts are geared towards supporting facilities to implement the WHO QOC standards for mothers, newborns and children, and support the application of learning from MPDSR.
The UNICEF-supported activities aim to strengthen the continuum of care for maternal, new-born and child health with emphasis on three result areas including;

Increasing availability and service readiness of Essential Maternal New-born Child Health services (Emergency Obstetric and New-born Care, Ante Natal Care, Deliveries, Post Natal Care, Integrated Community Case Management) at the facility and community levels in priority districts
Increasing utilization of quality maternal, new-born child health services, including emergency obstetric and new-born care at the community and referral facility levels
Increasing community awareness, demand and acceptance of lifesaving MNH interventions through innovative approaches for MNCH services.

To strengthen the availability and quality of services for critical care for mothers, UNICEF will recruit an obstetrician on consultancy terms to support Ministry of Health, targeted hospitals and districts to support functionalisation of High Dependency Units (HDUs), provide technical oversight and strengthen systems for the implementation of MNCH quality improvement guidelines and standards as described below in the tasks/deliverables.
PURPOSE OF ASSIGNMENT:
The consultant will work in collaboration with the MoH National Expert Group, UNICEF MNH team in Kampala and UNICEF Health Specialist in Gulu zonal office to establish and functionalize 10 High Dependency Units for care of mothers with critical care needs in selected hospitals of West Nile region and the Kawempe National Referral Hospital, in line with the national quality of care standards
To achieve this the consultant will:

support the development of key guidelines, protocols and tools on maternal critical care;
support set up and build capacity of clinical teams in targeted hospitals to provide critical maternal care;
track HDU performance using agreed monitoring framework, identify bottlenecks, propose solutions and assist the hospital teams implement those;
document the set-up/implementation process and capture evidence of improvement capacity to manage critical maternal cases, good practices and lessons learned.

Scope of Work 
Overall objectives: As part of UNICEF support to strengthen the maternal and new born health with a focus on quality improvement, the consultant will closely work with MoH national expert group on safe motherhood, UNICEF MNH Specialists, UNICEF Zone office health teams and identified health facility management and clinical teams  to: Develop and disseminate protocols on management of maternal complications

How can you make a difference?
In 2012, the World Health Assembly approved a Global Nutrition Monitoring Framework (GNMF) that includes six global nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025. The nutrition priorities in the GNMF are also embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) specifically the SDG2 that states “By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/covid-vaccine-update-coronavirus/n, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons”.
Timely and quality data with adequate level of disaggregation are essential to guide country programmes to allocate resources and to monitor progress in nutrition programming. Many countries including Uganda have committed to implement the 20 indicators included in the GNMF to track nutrition targets and to monitor nutrition interventions. The MoH in Uganda has integrated nutrition data elements and indicators into the Health Management Information System/District Health Information System II (HMIS/DHIS2). However, critical gaps in quality, collection and use at national level as well as sub national levels to report on the GNMF indicators and to also inform policy formulation remain glaring.
Under the UNICEF’s framework to health systems strengthening, improving data and information systems and supporting improvements to the HMIS has been an area of focus. The availability of timely and reliable nutrition and health information supports the development of nutrition and health-related policies, strategies, plans and budgets at national level and improves decentralized capacity for management. Furthermore, this provides the necessary information for evidence-based prioritization, resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation. Data availability at health facilities and districts levels enhances local decision-making, targeted service delivery and improvements to interventions. A UNICEF nutrition review of DHIS2 and routine reporting systems in 21 countries, including Uganda, reported a lack of standard definitions for nutrition indicators, data quality issues and recommended standardization and appropriate customization of indicators in the DHIS2[1]. In addition, this review also recommended improved data visualization such as the use of dashboards to maximize use. The aim of a DHIS2 dashboard is to visualize at a glance current performance of selected key indicators in the DHIS2.  Although in January 2020, the Ministry of Health finalized and rolled out a revised HMIS/DHIS2, a number of recommendations from this report, still need to be addressed. For example, there are no nutrition dashboards that would show current nutrition program status and support actions and decision making, suggesting that use of the data collected in the DHIS2 is not optimal. In addition, the capacity of MOH Nutrition staff at the national, regional, district and health facility levels in using DHIS2 remains suboptimal and yet is important to ensure that maximum use can be made of the routine HMIS and the rich information it can provide.
With funding from the European Commission, UNICEF and WHO, in April 2020, launched a joint programme aimed at improving national nutrition information systems under the Ministry of Health (MoH). Expected outcomes from this four-year support to the MoH include a revised national nutrition monitoring framework; web and paper-based nutrition data training modules; enhanced human resource for nutrition for data collection, analysis, interpretation and use; availability of quality and timely nutrition data and improved dissemination of nutrition information. Since the rollout of this support to the MoH, a number of strides have been made, including the implementation of national level inception meeting that included all stakeholders, establishment of a steering committee and the development and approval of workplans for the first two years of the project.
UNICEF is seeking to hire a national consultant to provide technical support to the MoH to strengthen the availability, quality and use of nutrition data in HMIS/DHIS2. The consultancy is being funded by the EU funded WHO-UNICEF Joint Program in support of the Ministry of Health of Uganda.
PURPOSE OF ASSIGNMENT AND SCOPE OF WORK:
In collaboration with WHO, provide technical assistance to the MoH Divisions of Nutrition and Health Information:

Review and refine the national nutrition monitoring framework and work plan, including the review and finalization of a list of standardized nutrition indicators from the GNMF with definitions, numerators and denominators clearly stated that can be easily adopted by nutrition stakeholders and customized into the DHIS2.
Advise on adopting the standard set of nutrition indicators within the national health information system
Participate in relevant technical working groups and engagement in national data review processes, e.g. thematic data review meetings, data cleaning exercises etc.
Ensure standardized nutrition dashboards are available and in use at the national, regional and district levels.
Support capacity building to the MoH, Regional and district nutrition personnel around Nutrition Information Systems including the use of the HMIS/DHIS2; quality assurance / quality control of data and use of data for program improvements among others.
Provide technical assistance to the MoH and stakeholders in development of resource material including manuals, standard operating procedures, data quality assessment tools etc. as resource guides for the roll out of the HMIS/DHIS2. This will include development, stakeholder review, validation and roll out.
Provide technical assistance to the MoH with development of nutrition quarterly bulletins and advocacy briefs on key nutrition indicators in districts with humanitarian context, national level and develop and recommend action points to inform improvement.
Support the MoH Divisions of Health Information and Nutrition to implement monthly nutrition meetings for data in the thematic technical working group.

UNICEF supported the Department of Teacher Instructor Education and Training -MoES with a Consultant (for a period of eleven months) to provide the necessary technical support to kick start the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Teacher Incentive framework. The consultancy mainly focused on the development of working guidelines including; the Action Plan for the implementation of the Teacher Incentive Framework, guidelines on provision of Teacher incentives, recognition and rewards.
The overall objective of the assignment was to provide technical support to the Ministry of Education and Sports to implement the Teacher Incentive Framework, ensure quality assurance, establish a sustainable mechanism and strengthen the initiative within the system. This is because provision of incentives and opportunities for recognition to teachers will enhance professionalism, competencies and ethics, leading to improved teacher motivation and quality of teaching and learning.
What has been achieved  
From the previous consultancy the following achievements were registered;

Developed the guidelines and Action Plan for the Implementation of the Teacher Incentive Framework (TIF) in Uganda. 
Developed an abridged version of the Teacher Incentive Framework for Uganda.
Developed a report on good practices on provision of incentives and rewards in 10 Quality Enhancement Initiative (QEI) Districts in Karamoja and West Nile regions.
Developed the guidelines for the provision of Incentives and Rewards to Teachers in Uganda.

The final ESSP (2021-2025) provides for Teacher motivation as one of the key interventions for the Teacher Instructor Education and Training department-MoES, which is a direct intervention in the implementation of the National Teacher Policy. Initial interventions are being tried out in the UNICEF focus districts to inform scale up.
Related to Teacher motivation, the current COVID-19 Pandemic has greatly affected the learning process resulting into school closure since Friday 20th March 2020, with candidate classes resuming school for term II in October 2020. This is believed to have caused a lot of psychological stress and anxiety in both teachers and learners.
Basing on the above background therefore, UNICEF in collaboration with the MoES would like to operationalize the Teacher Incentive Framework (TIF) and attempt to address the effects caused by COVID-19 using the guiding documents that have been developed in the first phase of the consultancy.
It’s in this regard that UNICEF proposes to recruit a consultant to conduct a Rapid Assessment on the Impact of COVID-19 on teachers performance and support the implementation of the Teacher Incentive Framework for a period of 11 months. (equivalent to NOC level)
SCOPE OF WORK:
The overall objective of the assignment is to implement the Teacher Incentive Framework for Uganda in the 29 UNICEF supported Districts. First the assignment will be preceded by a Rapid Assessment on the impact of COVID-19 on teachers.  This would include working closely with the target District Local Governments and UNICEF Zonal Offices at the field level and coordinating with the Ministry of Education and Sports-TIET department, Basic Education Department and Ministry of Local Government at the National level
It’s expected that the consultant will engage actively with the Teacher Instructor Education & Training (TIET) Department, Basic Education Department of the MoES, Ministry of Local Government, District Local Governments, Secondary School Department, Special Needs and Inclusive Education Department, Uganda National Association of Teachers Union (UNATU) and with the other relevant stakeholders including parents and learners, she/he will work closely with the three UNICEF Zonal  Offices in the implementation of the TIF.
The following are the expected outputs from the consultancy.

A Rapid Assessment Report on Impact of COVID-19 on teachers with key issues and recommendations for action.
District action plans developed on payroll management, teacher incentives and rewards in at least a half of the 29 UNICEF supported Districts
Operationalization of the National Teacher Recognition and Reward Framework.

How can you make a difference?
Key End-Results:
1. Reduced attrition of UNICEF Indonesia’s existing monthly donors: More than 55,000 individual donors have already decided to become a “Pendekar Anak” and support UNICEF Indonesia’s work for disadvantaged children with a regular gift. Sadly, many of them drop out over time – some because they actively cancel their donation as they cannot afford it anymore, decided to support other causes, etc., but even more of them simply because their credit card expires or other technical reasons that the donor often is not even aware of. Your work will reduce this attrition, because you create inspiring donor journeys, develop effective approaches to address technical issues that may otherwise later lead to drop-outs, and work with the donor care team to find the right conversations in the right channels to save donors.
2. Increased value of monetary contributions coming from UNICEF Indonesia’s individual donors: Donors usually sign up to support UNICEF with a standard amount. But some of them may have the potential (and the willingness!) to actually donate more. Your work helps our team to ask them in a compelling way at the right moment with the right inspiring message.
Key Accountabilities, Duties & Tasks: 

Reporting directly to the Head of Individual Fundraising, you will  focus on retaining, cross-selling, and upgrading individual donors (especially pledge donors) to grow un-earmarked funds for the country programme as per agreed targets.
Closely collaborate with the acquisition and donor content team to create an excellent donor experience from the point of sign-up to retention and upgrade.
Develop an inspiring donor journey for existing donors (both pledge and cash), by focusing on audience-led communication and the powerful impact of pledge giving.
Formulating cross-platform content strategy to communicate with donors beyond the traditional channels, i.e.; WhatsApp, social media, etc.
Support the supervisor and the Chief of Fundraising in making decisions by providing analytical reports and evidence-based recommendations for your area of work and beyond.
Contribute to relevant planning, monitoring and reporting to the Chief of Fundraising, Regional Office and Headquarters.
Collaborate with peers in other UNICEF offices across the world, Regional Office and Headquarters to identify successful approaches and best practices to guide our work in Indonesia – including the test of innovative approaches that have or have not worked elsewhere.
Manage external service providers and other partners for your area of work. This includes responsibility for the relevant procurement and contracting processes, budgeting, and the payment of invoices.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you.

UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
In early 2020, the Executive Director requested an organizational improvement exercise to reimagine UNICEF’s current business models with the specific aim of making them fit for purpose as one of the key drivers of accelerated action for children.

How can you make a difference?
Background
 
The third programme component of the current UNICEF Country Programme with the Government of Romania (2018-2022) covers the work that UNICEF undertakes with national partners to improve the enabling environment for child rights realization. The outcome to be achieved is the “enhanced the capacity of central authorities to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate evidence-based policies for children and their families, focusing on the most vulnerable”. It also seeks to strengthen key partnerships to increase national commitment for children and for social reforms. UNICEF provides technical assistance and capacity-strengthening to support the scaling-up of tested and evaluated models, facilitate the development of policies and the allocation of budgets at all levels of administration.
 
The Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI)[1] is a UNICEF-led initiative that supports municipal governments in realizing the rights of children at the local level using the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as its key foundation. The initiative is currently implemented in over 40 countries at global level (over 10 countries are currently exploring CFCI implementation), in over 3,000 cities and communities and involve 30 million children and youth worldwide. It is also a network that brings together government and other stakeholders such as civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, media and, importantly, children themselves who wish to make their cities and communities more child friendly.
 
A “Child Friendly City” is a city, town, community or any system of local governance committed to fulfilling child rights as articulated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is a city or community where the voices, needs and priorities of children are an integral part of public policies, programmes and decisions influencing their lives and future.
 
Broadly speaking, it is a city, town or community where children:

Are protected from exploitation, violence and abuse.
Have a good start in life and grow up healthy and cared for.
Have access to quality social services.
Experience quality, inclusive and participatory education and skills development.
Express their opinions and influence decisions that affect them.
Participate in family, cultural, city/community and social life.
Live in a safe secure and clean environment with access to green spaces.
Meet friends and have places to play and enjoy themselves.
Have a fair chance in life regardless of their ethnic origin, religion, income, gender or ability.

 
The UNICEF Country Office in Romania has decided to join the initiative and pilot CFCI in five municipalities in Romania in the framework of the project Making social inclusion real - breaking the cycle of exclusion for the most vulnerable children in Romania to be funded from Norway Grants 2014-2021.
Furthermore, there is interest from other municipalities in Romania to join the initiative and receive technical assistance from UNICEF for this endeavour.
 
Justification
 
UNICEF supports key counterparts in monitoring child rights through an integrated monitoring mechanism to support evidence-based policies and budgets for the well-being of disadvantaged children.  
 
Investing in children and families through the CFCI

improves the image of a city or municipality;
boosts the local economy by building the city or community’s brand as a sustainable, inclusive and child-friendly place to live and visit, which benefits local business;
attracts and retains families through better services for children;
provides a framework for cross-cutting interventions on issues such as road safety, pollution, child protection, crime etc.;
builds stronger local communities, increases social capital and reduces social exclusion that not only causes individual suffering, but also leads to high costs in the long-term;
builds more efficient services responding to evidence-based needs, as they are informed by children’s voices;
fulfills the country’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

 
Implementation of the Child Friendly Cities Initiative is a complex process that includes the following steps:

child rights situation analysis
prioritization of goals within the Goal and Results Framework
elaboration of a CFCI Action Plan and budget
CFCI candidate logo
implementation of the CFCI Action Plan (2-5 years)
evaluation of the progress
CFCI logo and UNICEF recognition

Therefore, specific support and advice is needed for establishing the framework at national and community levels and for the implementation of the initiative at municipality level.
