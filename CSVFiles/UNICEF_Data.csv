About the End Violence Partnership
Every year, over 1 billion children experience violence.  Violence in childhood undermines all other investments in children: in their health, education and development, often with negative lifelong consequences. Recognizing the devastating impacts of violence against children, in 2015 world leaders committed to end all forms of violence, abuse and neglect by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and an associated Fund.
The End Violence Partnership engages governments, UN agencies, international organizations, civil society, faith groups, private sector, foundations, academics and children themselves – uniting their voices, actions and resources in a unique public-private collaboration focused solely on ending all violence against children (VAC).
The ‘Pathfinding’ model is at the centre of End Violence’s strategy. Pathfinding countries are those whose governments commit to comprehensive action to end all forms of VAC. The Pathfinding model has potential to serve as an ideal platform for coordinated national action to scale up the INSPIRE Seven Strategies for Ending Violence Against Children. 
In four years, the Partnership has helped develop and promote the INSPIRE strategies; enrolled more than 30 Pathfinder countries; launched an innovative initiative with education sector partners to end violence in and through schools; awarded some $57 million in grants to tackle childhood violence online, in schools and in humanitarian situations; welcomed over 550 organizations as members; and galvanized those working to end violence through collective advocacy and events including an inaugural Solutions Summit.
The COVID-19 pandemic has put children everywhere at even higher risk of violence and abuse and threatens to undermine progress made in recent years. But COVID-19 has also heightened awareness, inspired new collaborations, and demonstrated the value of End Violence as a global platform for collective, evidence-based advocacy, action and investments. Together, we have a window of opportunity to translate the rhetoric of building back better into a reality for children.
Key tasks and responsibilities
Working closely with the Executive Director, Deputy and Leadership Team, and with external partners, the consultant will:

Monitor and analyse political and budget planning cycles within countries to assess countries’ readiness to end violence against children, using information on donor cycles, key political moments and other ongoing activities. Organize high-level policy dialogues;
Depending on evolving needs, provide support during key moments of the Pathfinding process, including launch of a national action plan and public declarations to end VAC;
Encourage and support engagement of donors in countries and ensure integration of other Partnership initiatives (Safe to Learn, Safe Online, Corporal Punishment) and EVAC frameworks (e.g. INSPIRE) into strategic planning;
Co-create and participate in global, regional and national initiatives to raise awareness, stimulate leadership commitment to action, and raise the standard of national violence prevention efforts;
With partners, ensure that a work plan is in place for the INSPIRE Working Group and is implemented and monitored. With co-coordinators, organize events, oversee communication mechanisms (website, emails etc.) and products;
Represent the Partnership in meetings and events with high-level government officials, interagency networks (UNGA, WHA, HLPF, CRC), multilateral and bilateral agencies, key institutions, CSOs, private sector and others, and advocate for the goal of ending VAC;
Identify strategic alliances and influence policy development and resource mobilization to facilitate achievement of the Partnership’s goals;
Monitor the overall commitment, expenditure and activity reporting of funds, and take necessary action for optimum use of available resources;
Support preparation and implementation of governance meetings, notably the Pathfinding Progress Working Group, and provide support to a small internal Pathfinding team.

However, spaces and opportunities for youth engagement and youth-led initiatives remain limited. In this context, through its strategic interventions UNICEF targets to build sustainable platforms for a dialogue between youth and decision-makers and spaces for youth engagement into life of their communities. These interventions contain strong capacity-building modules for young people, including training on life and social innovation skills.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates the commitment of children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
In line with Every Child Learns, the 2020-2030 education strategy, UNICEF is investing more improved learning and skills development for boys and girls from early childhood to adolescence, in particular for the most marginalized and those affected by humanitarian situations. UNICEF strategy promotes intersectoral approaches that use schools as platforms to deliver integrated services, including the promotion of mental health and psychosocial well-being of children, adolescents, and teachers and the integration of mental health and psychosocial support services in UNICEF and partners interventions in humanitarian and fragile contexts. Investing in children and adolescents’  learning,  skills and mental health and wellbeing is a priority for UNICEF. 
UNICEF advocates for mental health as a holistic issue that is relevant to every sector of development and embraces all SDG's as determinants of mental health and psychosocial well-being, underpinning the prevention, promotion, treatment continuum and an approach that is collaborative, multi-sectoral, and spam across health, social and child protection, education, gender, and other sectors in order to be effective in addressing the global burden of mental health problems. UNICEF MHPSS interventions approach is multilayered and multi-sectoral. It encourages a life cycle intervention to promote positive mental health (supporting people to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles and create supportive environments), together with prevention measures by addressing the root causes of stigma, hopelessness, distress, and trauma; the protection of human rights and the care and treatment of children, adolescents, and caregivers affected by mental health conditions.  UNICEF framework for mental health and psychosocial support highlights education as a critical entry point. It promotes the use of schools and non-formal learning spaces to offer multiple critical services for children and adolescents' mental health and well-being.
UNICEF’s has a focus on the most disadvantaged children and adolescents, including those who have dropped out of school or are at risk of dropping out, and older adolescents who are not in employment, education or training.  All programming aims to be multi-sectoral, address issues of exclusion, tackle gender inequities and negative social norms, and provide high quality and relevant learning opportunities.

UNICEF has been using UNISON (UNICEF’s CRM tool on the SALESFORCE platform) to manage partnerships since 2015. However, this tool has been used inconsistently and is underutilized in this regard across all levels of the organization.

1. Build the capacity of Partnerships teams at the Regional Office and Country Offices across MENA; and proactively guide and support them in the effective use of UNISON.
2. Support Partnerships teams at the Regional Office and Country Offices across MENA to upload new information; and ‘clean-up’ existing data in UNISON to ensure it accurately reflects the portfolio of existing partnerships and new business opportunities.

Since 2011, UNICEF worked closely with the  partners to support basic service provision; to build a protective environment for children; and to contribute to evidence generation and evidence-based policy dialogue. Gender, youth, and children on the move were critical cross-cutting priorities throughout the year. UNICEF’s nine Annual Work Plans, signed with relevant line ministries for 2019-20, were revised to incorporate COVID-19 prevention, mitigation and response. Where basic services were not available for the most vulnerable, UNICEF provided humanitarian assistance in line with the Humanitarian Response Plan 2020 with international and national NGO. 
Access to and quality of healthcare significantly deteriorated in 2020, with a grave risk of increased communicable and non-communicable disease. An estimated 1.2 million people are in need of primary and secondary health services, including 425,705 children. More than half of the health care facilities functioning in 2019 have closed due to security issues and funding deficits. Those that remain open are constrained by significant shortages of staff, medicines and supplies; notably, an estimated 70 percent of primary health care facilities do not have the 20 most essential medications. During two months in 2020, there was a stockout of essential vaccines, including those that prevent childhood diseases such as measles and polio. By the end of the year, there were indications that another vaccine stock-out was imminent.
The COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rate have steadily increased in 2021. The deterioration in the healthcare system has hampered efforts to control COVID-19. Existing treatment and testing facilities are predominately located in Tripoli and Benghazi; large areas of Libya are without access to services. Significant gaps in the availability of Personal Protective Equipment as well as inadequate measures to prevent and control transmission have resulted high healthcare worker transmission rates. Risk Communication and Community Engagement are vital to stopping further transmission, but local capacity is limited. 
UNICEF programmes are generously funded by a multiple donor include the EU and BMZ.  In order to ensure timely and quality reporting to the donors and other stakeholders, UNICEF will strengthen its internal CSD capacity of reporting by hiring a national reports officer at NOA level.

UNICEF has been working in Cameroon since 1975 in order to allow women and children to fully realize their rights to development without restriction, as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. UNICEF provides financials and technical support to Cameroon across seven areas in an effort to fully realize the rights of women and children. These areas include Health, HIV/AIDS, Water-sanitation-Hygiene, nutrition, education, child protection and social inclusion. UNICEF focuses mainly on children and the most vulnerable and excluded families. Cameroon 2020 population is estimated at 26,545,863 people according to UN data. The population is young and generates strong socioeconomic demand. In rural areas, limited access to basic social services and effects of climate changes lead to household impoverishment and severe child deprivations. The task is immense but not insurmountable; it requires the energy of all stakeholders in Cameroon and out of Cameroon: also, women, men, youth and children, government, technical and financial partners, donors, civil society, the private sector, parliamentarians, communities. Everyone is invited to take part in the struggle to meet the challenges that lie ahead. It is together that we will act for Cameroon, a country which summarizes the challenges and hopes of Africa.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
 
For every child, opportunities.
How can you make a difference?

Background

 
The Roma are one of Europe’s largest and most disadvantaged ethnic minority groups. While some have overcome, millions live in slums and lack access to the basic services they need, from healthcare and education to electricity and clean water. Discrimination against Roma communities is commonplace, fueling their exclusion. Far from spurring support for their social inclusion, their poverty and poor living conditions often reinforce the stereotyped views of policymakers and the public. And far from receiving the support that is their right, Roma children face discrimination that denies them the essentials for a safe, healthy, educated and protected childhood.  
 
There is a general absence of adequate information and quality data on Roma populations in Romania relating to topics key to the rights of the child, including education, health and nutrition, and living conditions, resulting to Roma children being particularly vulnerable as they too often remain out of sight of the authorities. Roma settlements are often isolated on the outskirts of villages and towns, and with poor housing, sanitation and hygiene conditions, and Roma communities face multiple and inter-related segregation, educational deprivation, forced evictions and systemic discrimination, leading to poverty and exclusion.
 
When it comes to education, significant disparities are apparent across all ages. Only 3% of Roma children under 3 are enrolled in crèche/kindergarten compared to 22% of non-Roma children. For the age group 3-6 years, 39% of Roma children are enrolled in crèche/kindergarten compared to 86% of non-Roma. For the age group over 6 years old, 81.5% of Roma children are enrolled in school compared to 99.2% of non-Roma. There are also consistent inequities between Roma and non-Roma children in terms of learning outcomes and scores on critical competencies. Further, among the estimated 400,000 children that are out of school (2016), Roma children are overrepresented. Finally, Roma children are six times more likely than other children not to complete secondary education. We see similar trends in other areas of child rights, such as health, protection and participation.
 
The Government of Romania has made steps to address the needs of this marginalized population through the National Strategy on Roma Inclusion (2017-2021). The current strategy is focused on key areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing in geographical areas where there are concentrated numbers of the Roma population. However, policies initiated and implemented tend to be generic and fail to adequately distinguish between the large socio-economic differences present, and the diversity in the education level of the targeted populations.
 
In 2019, the EU adopted a resolution on a Strategic Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies. This has been followed by the development of a survey in 2020, led by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, to collect and compare data in eight EU member states (and two accession countries). The survey collects information about Roma socio-economic conditions and their experiences of discrimination, harassment and violence, including those motivated by racism, and serve as a baseline for the post-2020 inclusion agenda, with results expected in mid-2021. More recently, the European Commission adopted a  EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation 2020-2030, a new 10-year plan, including a proposal for a Council Recommendation, to support Roma in the EU, for the next 10 years. With this framework in place, all EU governments should now start (or continue) to develop strong national Roma strategic frameworks.
 
UNICEF’s global commitment to equity – giving a fair chance in life to every child, everywhere, especially the most disadvantaged – is built on the conviction that it is right in principle and evidence that it is right in practice. In Romania, UNICEF focusses on the most vulnerable children – which include Roma girls and boys – across its programmes, communication and advocacy, with the aim to leverage their social inclusion.
 
UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children.
 
 

Purpose and Objective 

 
As part of a widened mandate UNICEF Romania is seeking to strengthen its programing towards Roma children within its reach through identifying opportunities and needs for action, as well as to support relevant National and Local authorities in the development of an effective policy framework and in the design of appropriate responses for ensuring the full realization of the rights of Roma children.
 
 

Scope of work

 
With a view of improving understanding of the needs and vulnerabilities of Roma children in Romania, supporting state actors in the design of adequate policies and progamming, and strengthening the effectiveness of UNICEF support to this population group, the Consultant - Roma Inclusion will undertake the following key tasks:
 

Analyze and document results achieved in relation to Roma children from recent and current interventions implemented by UNICEF and its partners, and other UN agencies through the review of reports, documents and interviews with selected UNICEF staff, partners and other stakeholders.
As a member of the internal Situation Analysis working group, ensure that the UNICEF situation analysis, undertaken by a separate consulting agency, includes an analysis of the situation of Roma Children in the Country.
Support the development of the new UNICEF Strategy Note as part of the preparation of the new Country Programme 2023 – 2027 with a view to Roma inclusion.
Assist the UNICEF Office in planning a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) with the aim to deliver quality disaggregated data by Roma and non-Roma.
Map actors and capacities engaged in advocacy, policy advisory and in delivering services to Roma populations and especially children, in Romania.
Support the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in the development of the new Child Rights Strategy focusing particularly on Roma Inclusion.
Organize a series of discussions with both UNICEF staff, UNICEF contractors and UNICEF partners around:

National Roma inclusion and its impact (or lack thereof) on Roma children.
Building more Roma inclusive environment (targeting UNICEF and partners itself).
Participate in sub-regional discussions on Roma inclusion organized by UNICEF regional and country offices.

For every child, results
Italy remains one of the main entry points into Europe for refugees and migrants fleeing conflicts, situations of violence and deprivation. Between 2014 and 2018, more than 70,000 unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) arrived in Italy by sea, 90 per cent of whom were between 15 and 17 years old. The continued significant presence of UASC (around 5,000 in reception centres in December 2020)) and the growing number of UASC who have turned 18 (around 60,000 over the last five years) are a cause for concern. In transit and at destination, UASC and young migrants and refugees continue to face many challenges and many gaps remain in the realization of their rights. One of the key issues of concern is that they do not feel heard and do not have anybody to talk to. Although they should be adequately informed about the decisions that affect them and their opinion taken into account, this does not seem to happen in practice. Building opportunities for them to engage in issues of concern to them in their local community not only supports their present and future civic engagement, but also contributes to their communities and societies.
To respond to these challenges, in 2016 UNICEF’s migrant and refugee response in Italy has modelled, piloted and rolled out U-Report on the Move, an adapted version of U-Report for UASC and young migrants and refugees. U-report is a mobile phone-based technology that provides a forum of opinion and information sharing for children, adolescents and adults. Using a crowd-sourcing approach to initiate a virtual dialogue with the members (‘U-reporters’), through U-report youth are able to respond to weekly polls and be agents of change in their communities. The ultimate aim of the programme is to stimulate citizen-led and adolescent/youth-led development. Once the information is collected the data is instantly analyzed. The information is subsequently utilized in communication and advocacy work across all media channels, many UNICEF programmes and through general partner engagement.
With nearly 6,000 U-Reporters registered by end 2020, U Report on the Move Italy is considered a best practice model within the U Report community and many of its features are replicated by other On the Move platforms globally.  Alongside online promotions via Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, in 2021 scale up efforts are being boosted by a team of Social Mobilizers responsible for promoting the platform in reception centers hosting unaccompanied and separated children, young migrants and refugees and fostering their engagement and participation. A dedicated App will also soon be piloted and rolled out for this purpose. The digital community relies on a pool of U-Ambassadors, young advocates from the migrant and refugee community who promote registration of U Reporters and participate in national and international high-level fora.  U-Ambassadors also participate in the U-blog platform and U-pod, a spinoff of U Report on the Move for engagement via blogging and podcasts.  The U-Partner platform, as a tool for individual case management, has become a key aspect of the platform, with a focus on legal case management and mental health support.  Likewise, Live Chat sessions and audio-visual material have become a key feature of the platform providing life protecting information to increase access to and uptake of services and generating a high level of engagement.  In 2021 a new platform, U Report Italy, dedicated to Italian youth will be deployed jointly by the Migrant and Refugee Response team and the Italian National Committee for UNICEF.
How can you make a difference?
Under the guidance of the YAD Specialist, and in collaboration with the U-Report Manager and the Italian National Committee, the U-Report Digital Mobilizer will support the management of Rapid pro software and manage social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, You Tube and Tik Tok) and content production for U-Report on the Move and U Report Italy.
This work will contribute to the implementation of the U-Report on the Move actionable responses and advocacy actions in support to the protection and social inclusion, including the promotion of alternative care, GBV prevention and response and fostering of adolescent participation and skills building. It will also contribute to the launch and first phase of implementation of U-Report Italy in collaboration with the Italian National Committee for UNICEF.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, innovate...
UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.
The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:

Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.
Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.
Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.

The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs – and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively.
We're an interdisciplinary team around the world tasked with identifying, prototyping, and scaling new technologies and practices. With our partners, we focus on convening and collaborating on new and different solutions, low- and high-tech,  by:

Looking at the 2-5 year horizon to evaluate emerging and trending technologies and to see how UNICEF can work with the private sector on doing better business while improving essential services for children;
Investing in early stage solutions that show great potential to positively impact children in the 0-2 year future including the Venture Fund that invests in open source technology solutions from start-ups based in UNICEF’s programme countries;
Identifying proven solutions that can be implemented at national scale in multiple countries – taking the ideas that help thousands in one country, bringing them to dozens of countries across multiple sectors, and impacting the lives of millions of children.”

Background on our blockchain/crypto work: 
UNICEF Ventures explores technologies, such as blockchain, with the potential to impact children and young people globally, providing them with information, opportunity and choice. The team sees blockchain technology as having benefits in three main ways: 1) leveraging innovative financing models to distribute resources; 2) increasing the efficiency and transparency of processes, and; 3) incentivising and encouraging the creation and maintenance of open-source digital public goods. The approach to achieving this is by researching and prototyping with both internal and external stakeholders.
To understand the technical, social, ethical, and legal challenges of utilising blockchain technologies in our complex and interconnected world — the team is exploring this space with open eyes on practical experimentations of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and various types of tokens, as well as by supporting learning and training initiatives to build capacity.
How can you make a difference?
Help us design products, and partnerships around a set of distributed cryptographic applications to make the world better.   Build the narrative and collaborations around a new technology, create the methods for accessing this partnership, and work with a dedicated technology team to ensure that product is prototyped and iterated upon quickly.
This is a role for someone who has built open-source products before, and taken them to a large number of users.  You know about rapid testing, agile development (at least from a product-manager if not project-manager point of view).  You can tell a story, sell an idea, and comfortable work with a distributed team of nerds to help build out a vision.  You understand the difference between ETH and ETC and can communicate it clearly in a tweet.  Or a few tweets.  You have an understanding of financial markets, exchanges, and smart contracts and (probably) find the term ""fintech"" frustrating. You can see a big picture but are able to help develop the minutiae of a plan, and understand how to adapt your communication style based on the audience you’re speaking to.
Your main responsibilities will be:

Identify and support promising blockchain based solutions for scaling through the portfolio mechanism, through technical support to the Fund’s investments, coordinating links to across UNICEF divisions
Act as a project manager related to specific blockchain initiatives led by UNICEF, when UNICEF itself is looking to use emerging technology;

This includes supporting Country Office pilots related to digital records, transfer of value or increased organisational efficiency
Identifying and supporting opportunities to use blockchain for internal efficiency


Act as a technical advisor to UNICEF related initiatives that require blockchain input, country-level pilots, HQ-led initiatives in various divisions, national committees, as well as internal and UN-wide working groups
Guidance to blockchain- and crypto-related partnerships and fundraising efforts

To qualify as an advocate for every child you will have…

An advanced university degree (Master’s or higher) in engineering, computer science, business administration or other relevant field.*A first University Degree in a relevant field combined with 2 additional years of professional experience may be accepted in lieu of an Advanced University Degree.
A minimum of five years of relevant professional experience in technology product development, project and partnership management
Technical understanding of decentralized systems and blockchain networks (e.g DLT, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Layer 2 solutions, DApps, DeFi and DAOs).
Piloting and scaling of technology solutions in UNICEF programme countries desired
Experience engaging with stakeholders from different backgrounds and coordinating multi stakeholder activities.
Demonstrated outstanding analytical and quantitative skills, and the ability to conduct independent research.

Background/ Regional Context
In West and Central Africa at least 41 million children are out of school – 29 million are in fragile countries such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon, CAR, Chad, DRC, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. In addition, in 2019 more than 12 million children were in need of humanitarian assistance in education, and in 2020 the Pandemic crisis (COVID-19) led to the closure of schools which implied that over 128 million children are temporarily out of school and need to continuing learning through remote learning approaches including digital learning. UNICEF has developed a strategy to respond to the COVID pandemic which promotes innovative ways to deliver remote learning through a wide range of approaches including online learning, television, radio, as well as provision of printed material to those in low connectivity areas. Since January 2021 all school are open in all 24 countries in West and Central Africa, however many concerns remain regarding possible growing number of countries that have experienced the new strain of COVID virus (which seems to be more aggressive), and/or an increase of cases. Schools could potentially act as a conduit for the spread of the virus leading to possible new closure. 
To this situation the West and Central Africa region, especially the Sahel and costal countries continue to face conflict and political instability that affect the life and the education of millions of children.
How can you make a difference?

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, [insert tagline]
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

For every child, protection
Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) is an institutional priority for UNICEF. Noted in its Strategic Plan 2018-
2021, building upon existing programming through child protection, health and education. Further, the recent Mid-Term
Review of the Strategic Plan has highlighted the importance of MHPSS across the organization, and a focus on this area
was further emphasized during the COVID 19 response.
 
Psychosocial support (PSS) is an integral component of child protection services in both humanitarian and development
settings. Such support services aim to address the psychological and social needs of children and families who are
vulnerable to or have been directly affected by violence, abuse, exploitation and/or neglect. It also responds to any
psycho-social needs, helping children to overcome difficult experiences, including in humanitarian contexts. These
efforts include culturally, age, gender appropriate, safe and stimulating activities to develop life skills, coping
mechanisms, and resilience. PSS services are often linked with other services such that referrals can occur for children
who may need extra support or protective services.
 
In all contexts, UNICEF strengthens the capacity of community members to support their children, be they part of the
social service workforce or families and neighbors. Types of programmes can include child friendly spaces to organize
activities in a safe and stimulating environment, help lines where children can ask questions and receive guidance. where
affected communities and children can be supported. In the context of COVID, PSS strategies in LAC have been focused
on strengthening virtual mechanisms for the care of children, such as helplines.
 

In the case of migrants there is a recognition of the need to different types of services. For example, the service may be
constrained by the time they are there, or if they have been returned to their country of origin how they perceive that
country for their future may be different from a person who has never thought of leaving. These services should also be
available even in transit areas and in their final destination. The support network around a migrant can be very different
from a person who is in their normal place of residence as most of them are mobile, and therefore the structures to tap
into for psycho-social support not as familiar to the migrant.
 

In diverse contexts throughout the region including those of natural disasters, human mobility and public health crises,
multiple models and approaches for providing this support have been develop and implemented. One missing piece in
the discussion however is the specific considerations for PSS programme design when working with migrants especially
children differentiated according to their age, sex and whether accompanied or not and differentiated as to the delivery
mode when working virtually and face-to-face. Further, while there are quality standards for PSS, these need to be
tailored to help orient such interventions and to support the monitoring of their implementation.
Given this, UNCEF through this consultancy seeks to deepen the interventions that are being developed in the region on
psychosocial support in the face of secondary prevention; as well as reviewing interventions aimed at migrant children
and in humanitarian settings.


How can you make a difference?
The purpose of this assignment is to support the UNICEF Regional Office in the identification of existing PSS
programmes and interventions in the Child protection system for children, particularly considering migrants and those
in humanitarian contexts, and develop a model of programme considerations against set standards.
 
Specific Tasks 
 

The consultant will be developing the following tasks:
 Identify Child Protection related PSS interventions of UNICEF in the region; existing resources, map with CO
and partners priority strategic areas for strengthening Child Protection PSS services, based on the mapping
developed by UNICEF LACRO/Health sector.
 Define any specific considerations taking into account for each type of service (e.g. child friendly space, helpline,
support group, etc.), reflecting on target population (e.g. migrant, interest group, etc.) and context (e.g.
humanitarian, mobility, etc.) as well as recognized PSS standards, for the implementation of PSS in different
contexts.
 Develop three CP-PSS case studies that highlight different interventions considering setting and target
population.
 Analysis (e.g. strengths, weaknesses, gaps) of current psycho-social support practices for migrant children in
the region and identification of potential future programming and research areas as well as any missing tools
in the provision of PSS for children on the move.
 Develop a guidelines for different members of the for child protection workforce, in coordination with other
social sectors, that articulate (i) placement of PSS in their work stream (ii) particular considerations if offering
PSS services (iii) considerations if the workforce member is considering a referral to a PSS service.
 Elaboration of a practical-short guide adapted to the region on quality standards for PSS in Humanitarian
settings.
 Presentation of the final deliverables virtually during webinars.

UNICEF has been working in Cameroon since 1975 in order to allow women and children to fully realize their rights to development without restriction, as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. UNICEF provides financials and technical support to Cameroon across seven areas in an effort to fully realize the rights of women and children. These areas include Health, HIV/AIDS, Water-sanitation-Hygiene, nutrition, education, child protection and social inclusion. UNICEF focuses mainly on children and the most vulnerable and excluded families. Cameroon 2020 population is estimated at 26,545,863 people according to UN data. The population is young and generates strong socioeconomic demand. In rural areas, limited access to basic social services and effects of climate changes lead to household impoverishment and severe child deprivations. The task is immense but not insurmountable; it requires the energy of all stakeholders in Cameroon and out of Cameroon: also, women, men, youth and children, government, technical and financial partners, donors, civil society, the private sector, parliamentarians, communities. Everyone is invited to take part in the struggle to meet the challenges that lie ahead. It is together that we will act for Cameroon, a country which summarizes the challenges and hopes of Africa.

For every child, 
I. Organizational Context and Purpose for the job
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
Job organizational context. The CAR CO currently operates in a complex humanitarian environment, and a rapidly changing context while its CPD (development programme) is well funded. The main office is based in Bangui and supported by 4 Field Offices, located in Bouar, Bossangoa, Bambari and Kaga-Bandoro. Due to the increased funding available especially resources from donors, volume of the office’s reporting requirement has increased since early 2019. Ensuring the quality and timeliness of donor reports, situation reports, flash updates, funding proposals and other external communication materials is essential for optimizing the office’s resource mobilization capacity and demonstrating “value for money” to donors through effective communication of results for children.
Purpose for the job. Under the supervision of the Partnership Specialist in charge, the post will contribute to the reporting functions in the Country Office, including timely preparation and completion of donor reports, situation reports, flash updates, proposals, presentations, briefing papers. The incumbent will manage donor reporting and other programmatic documents in collaboration with all the programme sections, the planning, monitoring and evaluation section and external communication section based on the workflow and tools. The position also has a critical role of continued capacity development of the team in result-based reporting, analytical writing and other skills required for quality donor reporting that is fundamental to the CO’s partnership management, advocacy and resource mobilization.

UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves. 
In particular, UNICEF will work so that:

Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

1. Contexte
 
Dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de la Politique Nationale de la Protection de l’Enfant et la Politique Nationale d’Egalité et Equité du Genre, la France finance à travers ses fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI), un projet de prévention de toutes formes de violences basées sur le genre et leurs conséquences en Union des Comores. La finalité de ce projet est de promouvoir l’égalité entre les sexes et de concourir notamment à l’élimination de toutes formes de violences à l’égard des femmes et des enfants des Comores. Le projet est construit en deux volets. Le premier volet a pour objectif spécifique de travailler avec les autorités nationales et auprès des organisations de la société civile chargées de la lutte contre les violences basées sur le genre. Le second volet a pour objectif de limiter les conséquences de la violence sur les victimes par une prise en charge intégrée et améliorée. L’UNICEF et la Croix Rouge Française sont chargés de mettre en oeuvre les activités de ce projet. Dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre du premier volet dudit projet, un travail de plaidoyer doit être assuré auprès des instances nationales à partir des cellules de coordination multisectorielle de proximité. A cet effet, le recueil des textes légaux portant sur la protection des enfants et des femmes établi en 2009 par le Gouvernement de l’Union des Comores avec l’appui de l’UNICEF et du PNUD doit être actualisé pour tenir compte des nouvelles législations favorables à la protection des enfants et des femmes notamment, le nouveau code pénal adopté par l’Assemblée de l’Union le 29 décembre 2020. Ce recueil doit ensuite être vulgarisé et disséminé auprès des acteurs étatiques et non étatiques en charge de la lutte contre les violences faites aux enfants et aux femmes. En outre le cadre juridique relatif à la structure nationale en charge de protection de l’enfant, doit être revu et amélioré.
Les travaux planifiés dans le projet de prévention de toutes formes de violences basées sur le genre et leurs conséquences en Union des Comores, doivent être mis en oeuvre par le Commissariat national de la solidarité, de la protection sociale et de la promotion du genre, une structure qui a des capacités limitées selon l’évaluation et la cartographie du système de protection de l’enfant réalisées en 2016 par Maestral International. En vue d’accompagner et d’assister ledit commissariat dans la mise en oeuvre des activités du projet, l’UNICEF lance cet appel à candidature pour recruter un cabinet / bureau d’études national ou une équipe d’au moins deux personnes physiques dont un senior pour une consultation juridique.

For every child, The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions of international, regional and local supply chains, undermining national response efforts and putting a strain on other critical and routine health services. This multi-faceted crisis has critically exposed the structural and operational limitations of existing health systems and underlying supply chain models, and calls for increasing the investments aimed at supporting governments in their efforts to build and manage stronger supply chain systems that are able to leave no child behind, operate at minimum capacity and meet surging needs.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, hope.The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
Strategic Office Context:
The Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action is a global network of operational agencies, academic institutions, policymakers, donors and practitioners. It supports the efforts of humanitarian actors to achieve high-quality and effective child protection interventions in all humanitarian contexts. The Alliance achieves this primarily by facilitating inter-agency technical collaboration, including production of technical standards and tools, capacity building, evidence generation, and advocacy on child protection in all humanitarian contexts. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) co-leads this network with a rotating NGO (currently, Plan International).
The Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action
The Alliance’s work falls into five broad categories:
•  Standard setting and guidance development: The Alliance develops standards for child protection in humanitarian action (CPHA) and generates technical guidelines and associated materials for use by humanitarian personnel.

UNICEF’s current Country Programme Document for Serbia (2021-2025), consistent with government priorities and the UNICEF Strategic Plan, aims to contribute to national efforts to progressively fulfil the rights of all children in Serbia, especially the most disadvantaged and excluded, and enable them to develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective society respectful of their voices.
In previous years, UNICEF in Serbia has supported the Ombudsman to produce a Special Report on the Status of Child Rights (2018), as well as its regular participation in ENOC (the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children) activities. In May 2020, ENOC and UNICEF conducted a short online survey on Ombudspersons and Commissioners for Children’s responses to the new challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently organized an online discussion.

To this end, UNICEF in Serbia is looking for a qualified consultant to provide professional expertise in support of the CRIA Assessment.
At the national level, the CRIA will enable the Ombudsman to assess the impact of state responses to COVID-19 on child rights. This initiative will strengthen the overall capacities of this NHRI in monitoring child rights, in line with its mandate. The mapping of how COVID-19 legislation and practices have affected child rights in Serbia, will contribute to lessons learnt for decision-makers in Serbia to ensure better preparedness and capability to respond effectively to similar challenges in the future. The Ombudsman will share the findings of the CRIA with the relevant national and local authorities in Serbia, as well as with regional and international bodies, such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in support of their respective activities with regard to child rights.

Depuis 2018, plusieurs notes budgétaires ont été élaborées pour servir d’outils de plaidoyer pour les ministères sectoriels, les organisations de la société civile auprès du Gouvernement, des institutions de l’Etat et des partenaires techniques et Financiers. Ces notes budgétaires ont permis la génération d’évidences qui ont été utilisées pour des plaidoyers en collaboration avec la société civile. Mais, il est apparu très important d’affiner les outils de plaidoyer en adressant les priorités des enfants dans des thématiques précises comme par exemple la nutrition, la préscolarisation et la protection de l’enfant. 
L’objectif principal cette activité est de produire des éléments d’analyse et de plaidoyer à utiliser par le bureau en vue de promouvoir des investissements équitables pour les enfants, à différents moments du cycle budgétaire. De manière spécifique, il s’agit de/d’: 

Informer l'UNICEF, la société civile, les universités, les partenaires au développement et le grand public sur les tendances en matière d'allocations et de dépenses dans certains secteurs sociaux de la loi de finances ;

Servir d’outil clé pour le plaidoyer en faveur d’investissements accrus et efficaces dans les secteurs sociaux dans le but de promouvoir l’équité et de réduire la pauvreté des enfants.

C’est dans ce cadre qu’il est prévu le recrutement des deux consultants nationaux qui devront disposer de l’expertise justifiée non seulement par rapport à la thématique des finances publiques en général mais aussi par rapport aux secteurs sociaux sensibles aux enfants (éducation, santé, protection de l’enfant, nutrition, eau hygiène et assainissement).

For every child, education.

For the interest of ensuring safety of children in schools in times of emergencies, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to develop the Education Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery strategy. The strategy is expected to provide guidance on the necessary infrastructure, resources and possible actions that can be put in place or taken by schools, and other education authorities to prevent and minimize the effect of any form of hazard, disaster or catastrophe that might affect the regular education provision in the country. The emergency preparedness, response and recovery strategy will enable the country to be alert of possible catastrophes and put in place measures that would enable the education sector to immediately intervene and protect the lives of children while keeping the teaching and learning process uninterrupted.

How can you make a difference?
The outbreak of COVID-19 taught us one major lesson: we needed to have systems in place to keep the teaching and learning process uninterrupted. It also taught us that we needed to have some preparatory measures that would enable the education sector to quickly respond to the pandemic. It has also acted as a wakeup call for the education sector to put in place a strategy that would guide our interventions during times of emergencies. As a nation, we need to be ready for any mishaps that are likely to affect not only the education sector but also other sectors which have direct contribution to the learning of the children. Thus, a call for the development of this strategy.

How can you make a difference
Background:
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak has infected millions of people across the world and caused significant loss of lives. Government of Botswana in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, has introduced a set of measures on prevention of COVD-19. Despite all the efforts put in place the country continue to experience a surge in cases and to date  the country has been registering more than 10 deaths per week.
In a bid to protect the country from the burden of morbidity and ultimately mortality, Botswana has joined global efforts and multiple platforms to accelerate the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.   Due to limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines, Botswana has took heed of the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)’s recommendations and ensured that the roll-out prioritized and conducted in phases, starting with the most vulnerable population being the senior citizens, those with comorbidities, frontliners, then gradually scaled up to the remaining of the population 18 years and above.  Botswana Government is expecting COVID-19 vaccine to arrive end of March 2021.
There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or hesitancy due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues. The global world has created room for infodemic, now people are saturated with a lot of information on vaccines which some is misleading and inappropriate, creating lack of confidence on the newly manufactured vaccines. [1] Community trust is key to ensure vaccine uptake and buy-in. To build trust and confidence among the population of Botswana, the Ministry of Health and Wellness conducted a Rapid Acceptance and Risk Perceptions Survey, in order to inform the planned population roll – out of the vaccines. The survey’s findings indicated that acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine is 73.4% while risk perception stood at 31.3%.  
Since vaccine roll out will be done in phased approach while manufacturers scale production, it is equally important that COVID-19 prevention and management measures continue to be strengthened through evidence based and impactful interventions
Currently, the Ministry of Health and Wellness has launched Communication Strategy for COVID-19 to ensure that the nation kick starts provision of accurate and up to date information on COVID 19 prevention, management and vaccine roll out, based on evidence generated as alluded by the survey.  Demand generation interventions will be put in place to encourage eligible populations to be vaccinated and at the same time manage public expectations and convey that vaccine will not be sufficient for everyone in the beginning.
Justification:
Communication for COVID-19 vaccine and Demand Generation is a key component in lessening the disease burden cause by COVID-19. The Government of Botswana, led by Ministry of Health and Wellness with Development Partners, including UNICEF, have provided leadership and guidance to the National Technical Working Group, which is now are ahead in preparations that have already conceived the necessary guiding tools and documents for the deployment of the vaccine.
UNICEF Botswana has increased responsibility to support the Ministry to execute the COVID-19 Vaccine Communication strategy and Implementation Plan. As such, a strong consultant with solid experience and expertise in RCCE, with more emphasis on immunizations will be required to support Ministry of Health and Wellness. As the assignment requires intensive dedicated work, full-time consultant is needed to support the pre, roll out and post phases of COVID 19 vaccine and ensure community engagement at all levels. Therefore, UNICEF Botswana is looking to recruit a consultant to provide rapid support to Ministry of Health and Wellness and partners on RCCE and vaccine demand generation.
Purpose and objectives of the contract:
The purpose of the contract is to provide technical support to the Ministry of Health and Wellness executing the strategy and implementation plan and monitoring of evidence-based risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) interventions, with a special focus on demand generation for the COVID 19 vaccine and continued COVID-19 prevention.
Objectives of the assignment: 
The consultant will be responsible for the following: -

Support implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Plan by coordinating with partners to strengthen evidence based RCCE and demand generation for COVID 19 vaccine introduction;

Strengthen behavior change communication plan (risk communication included) to support roll out of COVID-19 vaccine and related documents (SOPs, etc) at subnational level by engaging community leaders, local influencers and the House of Chiefs;
Develop communication materials based on rapid survey that was conducted and borrowing from the global guidance in partnership with MoHW and adapt where necessary.
Support and direct social listening/social media monitoring and data collection on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors around COVID-19 vaccination through Vox Pox, U-report, internet of good things and other local services;
Provision of support to the districts in order to bridge the gap.
Develop and adapt training material and facilitate training using the training material.



Scope of Work: 
Working under the direct supervision of C4D Officer and in close consultation with the Health Specialist, the C4D consultant will support the national RCCE committee to strengthen its evidence based RCCE and Demand generation strategy, plans for COVID 19 prevention and vaccine introduction and its implementation (as outlined in NDVP Chapter 8 Vaccination Acceptance and uptake). The work on vaccine demand generation planning will complement the ongoing work on COVID 19 RCCE work to ensure seamless coordination of ongoing response to vaccine introduction in the country,  and to continue the promotion of behaviors to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 both before and after vaccination,  prepare countries to respond rapidly to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs) with crisis communication plan, and an national/sub national advocacy plan to mobilize wide spread support for COVID-19 vaccination.
The consultant will be responsible for the following activities:

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
UNICEF is the lead agency in monitoring the wellbeing of children, with a mandate to support countries in collecting reliable data on children, as well as to track progress against internationally agreed targets including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Confronted with compelling evidence and sustained advocacy, the world has come to recognize that investing in early childhood development is an essential component of national and global prosperity. In 2015, early childhood development (ECD) became part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These global goals include a commitment to ensure that, by the year 2030, all children will have equitable access to quality early childhood development and early learning opportunities. SDG indicator 4.2.1 was chosen to specifically monitor the impact of government action towards this target, and UNICEF was tasked to lead the development of a measure to track progress.
In 2015, UNICEF initiated a process of methodological development that involved extensive consultations with experts, partner agencies and national statistical authorities. Over the following five years, a sequence of carefully planned technical steps were executed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the best items to measure SDG indicator 4.2.1. The work was overseen by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on ECD Measurement (IAEG-ECD), and was advised by a technical advisory group (TAG) composed of distinguished researchers, as well as practitioners with expertise in assessing children’s development across the world.
This process led to the development of an instrument to measure early childhood development in population-based surveys: the ECDI2030. The ECDI2030 comprises 20 questions which are intended to be administered to mothers/primary caregivers to collect information about the way their children behave in certain everyday situations, and the skills and knowledge they have acquired.
The ECDI2030 is intended to measure the achievement of key milestones in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, which are conceptualized as outputs in the child developmental process. That said, a comprehensive monitoring framework for ECD should also include indicators that measure relevant inputs that can have an influence on developmental outcomes among children. Factors such as children’s nutritional status, access to early learning opportunities, and exposure to responsive caregiving are important inputs, or determinants of ECD, to which children will be exposed in varying degrees.

 For every child, equity
Evaluation is a key function in UNICEF. Evaluation in UNICEF serves interrelated purposes in support of the organization’s mandate. It supports learning and decision-making, which in turn support better results for children. Evaluation also helps to hold UNICEF accountable for contributing to results for children, or for not doing so. Supports the development of national evaluation capacity, undertaken in collaboration with Member States and entities of the United Nations system, which should enhance the provision of timely evidence at the country level on the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and the fulfilment of the rights of all children.
UNICEF country programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean are typically designed to create the most appropriate enabling environment, through supporting adequate child-rights based policies and programmes and promoting legal frameworks in line with international rights-based standards and improving learning and capacity of government institutions. Piloting and modelling are implemented in the field to create evidence and engage local partners to identify solutions for children to be replicated or scaled up. In addition, UNICEF is frequently invited to provide top-expert advice on child-related policies. This type of efforts is complex and highly demanding in terms of time, investment and capacity, considering that it usually requires an inter-sectoral approach to address key systemic barriers that impede the full realization of children’s rights. This remains a challenge to demonstrate results that can be directly attributed to UNICEF and measure the actual contribution of UNICEF to high-level results.
The evaluation function in UNICEF LAC aims at helping to improve its performance and results, by supporting organizational learning and accountability. UNICEF LAC seeks to enhance the strategic role of Evaluations to understanding the context in which advocacy, policy advice, models and scaled up pilots can reach results at scale.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, innovate...
UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.
The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:

Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.
Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.
Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.

The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs – and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively.  UPSHIFT
UPSHIFT is one of UNICEF’s priority projects for scale in the Office of Innovation. UPSHIFT is a youth social innovation and social entrepreneurship programme, designed to build skills and opportunities for young people who are disadvantaged, due to (for example) poverty, gender, disability or ethnicity. The programme combines social innovation workshops, mentorship, incubation and seed funding, to equip young people with the skills and resources they need to identify problems in their own communities and design solutions for them. While young people build skills for life, employment and social entrepreneurship through UPSHIFT; their wider communities benefit from the solutions they create.
UPSHIFT is highlighted within Generation Unlimited, as a solution which should be scaled to address skills for employment, and the World Bank’s Solutions for Youth Employment Impact Portfolio as a promising solution to address youth unemployment.
UPSHIFT started in 2014 and now has presence in 35 countries, with a focus on both new countries piloting UPSHIFT and existing countries scaling into systems, with the support of digital tools and platforms.
How can you make a difference?
This role will lead the global scale up of UPSHIFT and will support the Office of Innovation in Field Engagement and Capacity Building in related areas. This role requires a flexible, can-do mindset, with deliverables subject to change, as we learn in real-time.
Main responsibilities will be:

Continue to implement the global strategy and plan for scaling UPSHIFT into systems in consultation with cross-sectoral specialists, experienced country offices and external partners
Proactively drive digital transformation as a key enabler for sustainable, scalable UPSHIFT models at country level
Provide technical support and advice to UNICEF Country Offices rolling out UPSHIFT, enabling them to adapt and launch UPSHIFT pilots
Manage the UPSHIFT global network as a dynamic and effective community of practice that supports south-south collaboration
In collaboration with PFP, NatComs and PPD support partnership activities for existing (Chloe, Pandora) and new UPSHIFT partners
Working with the Office of Research, support development of a measurement framework and toolkit for UPSHIFT
Ensure the UPSHIFT SharePoint resources are up to date as a useful and used repository for Country Offices to build their capacity around UPSHIFT and save time and resources across the organisation
Support internal and external communication activities around UPSHIFT
Support delivery of regional UPSHIFT workshops in the MENA and ESAR regions, as part of the Prospect programme
Using the extensive UPSHIFT CO network, support broader field engagement and listening across key related innovation portfolio areas (Youth, Learning, Gender Equality, MHPSW)
As needed, support delivery of capacity building activities relating to innovation and human centred design
Play an active role as part of the Field Engagement and Capacity Building team, supporting on other tasks, as agreed

Projects Partnership
The PROSPECTS Partnership aims to transform the way governments and other stakeholders, including the private sector, respond to forced displacement crises – and in particular:
(1) to enhance the enabling environment for the socio-economic inclusion of forcibly displaced persons (to mitigate their plight during years of exile and to best prepare them for their return);
(2) to enhance access to education and child protection for vulnerable children on the move; and
(3) to strengthen the resilience of host communities through inclusive socio-economic development that also benefits forcibly displaced persons.
 
The Partnership has a four-year initial time horizon (2019-2023). Financially supported by the Netherlands, partners will join their efforts to develop a new paradigm in responding to forced displacement crises. The Partnership is focused on three broad area that are critical for refugees to overcome their specific vulnerabilities and for host communities to pursue their own development agenda in a transformed environment: (i) jobs/social protection; and (ii) education and learning; and (iii) protection and legal status – with a view to pursuing sustainable and integrated approaches. Each institution will contribute in areas where it has a comparative advantage.
Operational activities are focused on two regions: The Middle East and North Africa (Jordan, Lebanon) and the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda). Activities are expected to cover both forcibly displaced persons (including refugees and internally displaced persons) and host communities in an integrated manner, as well as other vulnerable groups living in the same areas, as may be relevant in each context.
Under the PROSPECTS partnership, UNICEF’s ADAP and Innovation teams will be organizing a learning series for UNICEF country offices and PROSPECTS partners to build knowledge and expertise in the utilization of UNICEF’s young people programming resources, specifically the Adolescent Kit for Expression and Innovation and UPSHIFT.  This will be achieved through a series of virtual trainings, tailored mentorship and coaching.  The objective of this joint ADAP-Innovation activity is to: 

Share information on available tested and widely used resources for adolescent empowerment, social innovation and entrepreneurship; 
Support the country offices in identifying the best fitted mix of resources for their specific needs and parameters, as relevant;  
Build the capacities of the country offices and the implementing partners to apply these resources within their programmatic interventions supporting the delivery of the PROSPECTS results;  
Provide technical assistance, as needed, to the country offices in integrating these activities into wider programming (future MACPEs and beyond) 

How can you make a difference?
This role will support (1) the design, delivery and overall management of the “PROSPECTS Learning Series for Young People Programming” and (2) more specifically this role will support the development and delivery of the UPSHIFT capacity building sessions. This role requires a flexible, can-do mindset, with deliverables subject to change, as we learn in real-time.

The United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF) is a unique collaboration that brings together UN entities, governments, organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), and broader civil society to advance the rights of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and disability inclusive Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Disability inclusion in North Macedonia has gained traction with the CRPD ratification and its Optional Protocol in 2011. The progress with deinstitutionalization, made possible with the UNPRPD support, revealed the complexity, gaps and opportunities for scaling up CRPD implementation and disability inclusive development. The Government remains committed to equality and inclusion, including persons with disabilities. Capitalizing on the progress made, it aims to accelerate and deepen systemic reforms and give effect to the preconditions necessary for disability inclusion into policies, programs and services that are aligned with international norms and standards.
The UN Country Team in the country successfully applied for the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund, to jointly develop a country-level programme with the objectives to:

advance CRPD implementation at the country level by focusing on the essential preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, translating these into concrete policies, programs, and / or services which lead to systemic changes through a cohesive, inter-sectoral approach.
improve and increase the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level by providing fundamental support to the UN’s collective response to the SDGs to address national priorities and gaps concerning persons with disabilities in national planning.
Within the inception phase activities, an Induction Training is planned, with a purpose to develop understanding of and familiarity with the CRPD and disability inclusive SDGs and to deepen knowledge on the preconditions for disability inclusion required for inclusive policy making and programming, and to develop an understanding of the cross-cutting approaches underpinning all UNPRPD joint programmes.  Using standardized training package, the Induction Training targets participants from UN entities, government, Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) and any other partners that are involved in the country situational analysis, design and implementation of the proposed joint country level programme.

UNICEF is seeking qualified consultants with experience in disability and development and CRPD implementation. More specifically, UNICEF is seeking to engage skilled training facilitators, to deliver the UNPRPD Joint Program Induction Training on Cross-cutting Approaches and Preconditions for Disability Inclusive Development in North Macedonia, including:

A lead facilitator who will prepare and organize the Induction Training, implement multiple sessions and oversee the programme content, with significant demonstrated facilitation capability, content and context knowledge;
Co-trainer– Under the coordination of a lead facilitator/team leader, a co-trainer(s) supports the delivery of the training.

Under the supervision of the Child Protection Officer and in close cooperation with the UN project team, the Induction Training Facilitators will have the responsibility to:

Adapt the training package prepared by the UNPRPD Secretariat to the country context and needs;
Develop a plan for delivery of the Induction Training, including but not limited to development of a detailed agenda, distribution of tasks among the facilitators, designing sessions involving representatives of the OPDs as panelists, organize group work, etc. The training should be delivered remotely, or by using the hybrid modality in accessible facility settings, in a course of 6-7 days;
Deliver training by making sure that it is facilitated in an accessible manner. UN Agencies will ensure sign language interpretation is available, as well other options as required;
Conduct monitoring and evaluation of the training;

Background and Rationale
In September 2017, the EU and the UN launched a joint partnership to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide. The Spotlight Initiative (SI) aims to mobilize commitment of political leaders and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Initiative aims at ending all forms of violence against women and girls, targeting those that are most prevalent and contribute to gender inequality across the world. The Spotlight Initiative deploys targeted, large-scale investments in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Pacific and the Caribbean, aimed at achieving significant improvements in the lives of women and girls. Zimbabwe is one of the eight countries in Africa to benefit from this transformative initiative
SI VISION IN ZIMBABWE
The overall vision of the Spotlight Initiative in Zimbabwe is that women and girls realize their full potential in a violence-free, gender-responsive and inclusive Zimbabwe. The Spotlight Initiative is directly contributing to Zimbabwe’s achievement of three of the country’s prioritized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Goal 5 on Gender Equality, Goal 3 on good health and well-being and Goal 16 on inclusive and peaceful societies. The programme contributes to the elimination of SGBV and HPs through the creation of a broad partnership with Civil Society, Government, Private Sector, Media, among others; and, build a social movement of women, men, girls and boys as champions and agents of change at the national, subnational and community levels. A specific focus is on reaching and including in the programme women and girls who are often isolated and most vulnerable to Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) and Harmful Practices (HPs) due to intersecting forms of discrimination. The programme also seeks to address the SRHR needs of all women and girls using a life-cycle approach.
The SI Zimbabwe Country Programme uses a multi-sectoral, multi-layered, interlinked community-centered approach to the implementation of the interventions on the following six Outcome Areas based on the socio-ecological model for addressing SGBV and HPs;

Legislative and Policy Frameworks
Strengthening Institutions
Prevention and Social Norms
Delivery of Quality, Essential Services
Data Availability and Capacities
Supporting the Women’s Movement

UNICEF works heavily under Outcome 4 of the Spotlight Initiative to improve the delivery of quality, essential services. In light of COVID19 and the serious implications the national lockdown has had on GBV1, UNICEF is committed to ensuring that UNICEF and partners deliver innovative solutions to strengthen availability, accessibility and quality of GBV response services.

Background/Rationale for the Assignment
UNICEF SSCO through the Social Policy, Planning, M&E (SPPME) that oversees social protection programmes and Communicate for Development (C4D) team aim to establish a cash-for-work programme leveraging the network of community mobilizers across country, as potential social workforce to support critical life-saving social services including ongoing or upcoming UNICEF supported cash transfer programmes. The cash-for-work mechanism is a multi-purpose grant (MPGs) or a multi-purpose cash transfer (MCAs) programme targeting and leveraging the community mobilisers within the integrated community mobilization network (ICMN). The regular cash transfer payments will be made based on the level of engagement of the community mobilisers in UNICEF supported programmes as defined by UNICEF SPPME and C4D teams. The ICMN structure is stratified into community mobilizers, payam supervisors, county supervisors, state supervisors, and reaches the whole country across 10 states with critical and lifesaving information related to different thematic areas such sector including health, WASH, education, child protection and nutrition. A large proportion (20%) of the 2000+ community mobilisers are young people below the age of 30 and from vulnerable communities, therefore, is line UNICEF’s overall youth agenda.

How can you make a difference?
Rationale:
The revitalization of Primary Health Care (PHC) is a priority agenda for UNICEF ROSA. To accelerate transition from vision to action will require intense support by the Regional Office for South Asia to at least five of the region’s eight Country Offices to implement national PHC Costing Exercises that strengthen both effective coverage of PHC level health services and intersectoral collaboration for the production of improved community health outcomes. It is an effort that will permit UNICEF to partner with governments and other stakeholders to put planning and budgeting for adequate, sustainable and predictable investments in PHC at the center of social development and social protection as the pathway for the achievement of SDG target 3.8, which calls on all countries to achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. The work that this consultancy will support will focus on strengthening health systems for delivery of integrated MNCAH and Nutrition services at primary care level and essential public health functions and for strengthening multisectoral support systems for health outcomes (WASH, preparedness and response for health care needs in case of emergencies, and for C4D for SBCC, RCCE and accountability to communities).
ROSA wishes to engage a contractor to provide technical support and guidance to country offices for the development of PHC road map, guide the development of country specific PHC costing exercises and of multiyear PHC strengthening implementation plans and related management and governance roadmaps.

It is a set of tasks that require the recruitment of a public health expert with an extensive knowledge of PHC and experience in health care planning, budgeting and financing, experience at the national and subnational level, proven experience in developing technical guideline documents and evidence analysis for knowledge generation.
The assignment will require close follow up with participating country offices, need to be completed timely and workload, and therefore requires the full-time deployment of an expert for a period of about 11 months. Hence, it is a set of duties that cannot be undertaken by current ROSA staff members as part of regular duty.
Purpose:
The purpose of the assignment is two-fold: First, to produce guideline documents and tools to help country offices make strategic prioritization in the conceptualizing of their PHC care models and developing PHC road maps and technically support monitoring the implementations in countries.

The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC), led by UNICEF, was established in 2006 as part of the Humanitarian Reform process, which aimed to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response programmes by ensuring greater predictability, accountability and partnership. The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC) is a partnership that includes international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, UN organizations, donors and individuals. In 2015, the GNC undertook an assessment of its technical role along with the Rapid Response Team (RRT) evaluation. Both exercises identified serious gaps in addressing nutrition technical needs in humanitarian contexts.  In March 2016, the GNC constituted a Technical Task Force (TTF) co-chaired by UNICEF and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to review recommendations and propose a mechanism to address nutrition technical gaps. One mechanism was endorsed in March 2017 and is called the “Global Technical Assistance Mechanism for Nutrition” (GTAM).
The GTAM is a common global mechanism endorsed by over 40 Global Nutrition Cluster partners to provide systematic, predictable, timely and coordinated nutrition technical assistance in order to meet the nutrition rights and needs of people affected by emergencies. The Global Technical Assistance Mechanism for Nutrition (GTAM) is co-led by UNICEF as the Cluster Lead Agency, together with World Vision and is articulated around 3 pillars: pillar one-provide technical advice, pillar two-facilitate consensus driven guidance, pillar three-provide specialized technical expertise.
As part of pillar three and considering long process of advertising, selecting and recruiting individual consultants for nutrition in emergencies, development or preparedness work, the GTAM has established rosters of consultants in different technical areas, regularly updated, that allow to speed up recruitment process at country level. There are several rosters established, namely in

Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) – current roster
Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies (IYCF-E)
Micronutrient supplementation in emergencies
Integrated nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions
Needs assessment and analysis for nutrition outcomes (established outside of the scope of current recruitment)

How can you make a difference?
The GTAM is building a roster of professionals with experience in community management of acute malnutrition from which to draw consultants to be recommended to countries in need of nutrition support staff.

If approved by the reviewing committee, the candidate will remain in the GTAM Consultant Rosters database during 36 months, unless requested to remove her/him earlier. During this period, candidates might be consulted several times, depending on requests flow.
Any partners working in Nutrition (UN agencies, NGOs, Governments) can contact the GTAM Consultant Rosters to ask for recommendation of consultants. Consultancy proposed may range from 4 weeks to 11.5 months, depending on demand, project specifications and funding availability. Consultants recommended by the GTAM Consultant Roster and hired by the requesting agency will be issued a contract which is subject to:

UNICEF General Conditions of Contracts for the Services of Consultants / Individual Contractors if hired by UNICEF,
or governed by the individual partner conditions for individual consultant agreements if hired by another UN agency/NGO/Government.

Consultants may be requested to work in any country with a nutrition cluster or a nutrition sector, or remotely, as determined by the specification of the project.

The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC), led by UNICEF, was established in 2006 as part of the Humanitarian Reform process, which aimed to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response programmes by ensuring greater predictability, accountability and partnership. The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC) is a partnership that includes international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, UN organizations, donors and individuals. In 2015, the GNC undertook an assessment of its technical role along with the Rapid Response Team (RRT) evaluation. Both exercises identified serious gaps in addressing nutrition technical needs in humanitarian contexts.  In March 2016, the GNC constituted a Technical Task Force (TTF) co-chaired by UNICEF and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to review recommendations and propose a mechanism to address nutrition technical gaps. One mechanism was endorsed in March 2017 and is called the “Global Technical Assistance Mechanism for Nutrition” (GTAM).
The GTAM is a common global mechanism endorsed by over 40 Global Nutrition Cluster partners to provide systematic, predictable, timely and coordinated nutrition technical assistance in order to meet the nutrition rights and needs of people affected by emergencies. The Global Technical Assistance Mechanism for Nutrition (GTAM) is co-led by UNICEF as the Cluster Lead Agency, together with World Vision and is articulated around 3 pillars: pillar one-provide technical advice, pillar two-facilitate consensus driven guidance, pillar three-provide specialized technical expertise.
As part of pillar three and considering long process of advertising, selecting and recruiting individual consultants for nutrition in emergencies, development or preparedness work, the GTAM has established rosters of consultants in different technical areas, regularly updated, that allow to speed up recruitment process at country level. There are several rosters established, namely in

This  Initiative provides a model for partnerships with donors, civil society, and the UN to deliver on the SDGs in a comprehensive manner leveraging comparative expertise. SDG 5 and the achievement of gender equality are placed at the centre of efforts (alongside Goal 16) with the aim to provide an enabling environment for the implementation of all goals. Within the UN, the Initiative will operationalize the UN development system reforms and model a new way of delivering on the SDGs in an integrated way, leveraging collaborative advantages.

These actions will help address, among other things, the power imbalance and gender equality as a foundation for the work on Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG), siloed approaches, and matters of accountability within and between sectors. It will provide institutions with key tools to allow for increased “decentralized” responses in the sectors and in the local governance system to strengthen access to prevention and response services (including access to justice and social support.). 
 
The products of this consultancy will become a critical reference point for the work related to the gender-responsive planning and budgeting into government programmes and mechanisms for the systematic analysis of the impact of policies on EVAWG.

The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
Electricity is an important enabler and dramatically improves the quality, accessibility and reliability of education, healthcare and WASH services for children.  There are positive correlations between electricity access, health and education outcomes. In emergencies such as COVID 19, electricity in healthcare facilities is especially critical to treat patients, operate lifesaving medical devices and to meet cooling needs of the vaccine cold chain.  Similarly, reliance on remote learning and technology-based solutions that support continuous learning also rely on access to electricity, especially in rural areas, to address the risks of growing inequities. Access to modern, reliable energy also supports children and young people with person learning in school by enabling lighting, heating, ventilation, clean water supply, sanitation and hygiene services, cooking school meals, especially in areas that are not connected to reliable electricity grids.
Despite its importance, electricity access is often an overlooked building block of quality health and educational services. Some of the solutions to increase energy access in healthcare and educational facilities include extending the grid network, or connecting to decentralized solutions such as mini-grids or stand-alone solar PV systems, to ensure adequate service delivery. Decentralized solar energy solutions are promising options that can also simultaneously transform the sectors to a low carbon and climate resilient development pathway. This is a powerful benefit to children in the face of a changing climate and degrading environment.  There are limitations, however, in the form of limited data and market information on a granular (national and sub-national) level to understand the access gap, the demand for energy based on type and size of schools, healthcare facility, the cost of providing electricity, willingness to pay, the most appropriate delivery models and best sustainability measures including long term operations and maintenance (O&M) which is a major challenge.
UNICEF’s Section for Climate, Environment, Resilience, and Peace (CERP) contributes to Goal Area 4 “Every child lives in a safe and clean environment” of the Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Within the CERP Section, the Climate, Environment, Energy, and DRR (CEED) team in close collaboration with UNICEF HQ, Regional and Country Offices is committed to scaling up sustainable energy integration into UNICEF programme priority areas (e.g. WASH, Health and Education sectors) with a goal of accomplishing positive social and climate benefits for children.
Objective of the consultancy: The overall objective of the consultancy is to support the development of a standardized energy demand assessment toolkit for UNICEF to provide a comprehensive understanding of energy demand of healthcare facilities and schools in a defined geographic area (e.g. country, province, etc.). The consultant will take stock and consolidate existing data, evidence, identify gaps, and under the supervision of the CEED team support UNICEF regional and country offices in undertaking energy demand assessments and pertinent analysis. The consultant will support the CEED team in delivering on existing and any potential partnerships in a market shaping exercise for the most appropriate and cost-effective energy service delivery models for healthcare and educational facilities. 
Terms of Reference / Deliverables
To deliver on the above objective, the selected Consultant will undertake the following tasks, over a period of 6 months:

Stock-take existing data, information and tools to define energy demand of healthcare facilities and schools (20%):

Drawing from the above, consolidate a comprehensive inventory of existing data and information. Conduct a gap analysis to identify the gaps in data/information, and recommend approaches to fill the gaps.


Develop Toolkit for Demand Assessment and Identify Typologies for UNICEF Engagement (60%) 


Formulate technical guidance/methodology for country offices on conducting energy demand assessments to ensure harmonized country level assessments. This work should build upon existing approaches including those developed for UNICEF internal operations and country programmes such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, Kenya, etc. consider UNICEF products/markets analysis framework – affordability, willingness to pay for both cost of electricity services as well as long term O&M, availability, product and technology appropriateness, quality, market competition, delivery channels, and funding security) at select regions and geographies.
Support in the roll out of the toolkit and subsequent refinement eluate health and education benefits in children owing to increase in sustainable energy access, identify indicators and recommend monitoring methodology to track health and education outcomes in children. Evaluate climate benefit (carbon and climate resilience) in public institutions due to increased energy access.
Under the supervision of the CEED team, support the roll out of the toolkit in select geographies and in subsequent refinement of the toolkit. Where needed, provide technical advice and backstopping support to UNICEF regional and country offices towards country level energy demand assessments of healthcare facilities and schools.
Develop typologies for UNICEF engagements in promoting sustainable energy access based upon market segments uncovered during the energy demand assessment; e.g. purchaser of power, stakeholder convening for private sector involvement, IFI engagement, policy linkages, etc.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Education
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does, in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life, in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions, her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens, addressing inequity, not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
Purpose for the job:
The Education Officer reports to the Chief Education or Education Specialist for close guidance and supervision.

Assignment
The mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, thrive and develop to reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. Therefore, the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations. Strategic office context: 
UNICEF is constantly striving to improve our programmatic efforts within disability, with a focus on improving the availability and access to Assistive Technology products (AT) and disability inclusive products. Recent years has seen an increase in prioritization for this area in both the commitment of member states and donors. Programme Division (NY Headquarters) and Supply Division are working together to build on this momentum and make sure that UNICEF is well equipped to ensure a better future for children with disabilities through the introduction and adoption of quality and appropriate assistive technologies in UNICEF country programmes. In addition to ongoing efforts the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy was launched in 2019 to accelerate progress and increase accountability within the UN, it has four main pillars, Leadership, Inclusiveness, Programming and Organizational Culture. This consultant will assist in the implementation within the “Inclusiveness” pillar and its product-related elements as the primary focus: 1. Ensuring accessible procurement policies are implemented. 2. Ensuring accessible products and services are being procured. 3. Ensuring disability inclusive suppliers are considered. To help reach UNICEF strategic plan goals and successfully implement UNDIS, UNICEF SD aims to improve technical capacity by adding a Disability Products Specialist who will advise, consult, recommend, and drive adoption of AT products as part of UNICEF and partner government programmes. This consultancy will work in Supply Division providing direct support UNICEF regional offices on which disability products and services to select and incorporate into country programmes to achieve results for children in education, social protection, early child development and health. The consultancy will be supervised by the Innovation Specialist on Assistive Technology in the Product Innovation Center (PIC).

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, a future
Background and Rationale:
Building on the findings of the systematic review of evidence on violence against children in South Asia, the Child Protection Section is seeking to develop research to document the economic cost of violence against children in the region.  Estimating the economic cost of violence against children will support regional and country level advocacy for investment in child protection systems and provide baseline data for further reviews of investment and results in prevention and response to violence against children.  It will also help inform governments about the economic cost of inaction, and the implications this has for the achievement of, or lack of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on VAC. The research will inform policy makers of the impact of violence against children on economic and social development and support investment cases for SDG achievement.  
 The research contributes to the output 2.6 Child Protection; intermediate results 2; activity 2.3 on evidence generation.  As the research is of a highly technical nature, support is required from experts in economic costing which is not available within the regional office.
How can you make a difference?
Purpose:
UNICEF is seeking to hire a consultant to analyze the economic cost of violence against children in South Asia region[1] using a globally tested methodology and model, to inform advocacy and programming to end violence against children in the region.
A systematic review of the prevalence, drivers and consequences of violence against children in South Asia (UNICEF & University of Edinburgh, 2020) provides compelling evidence of the extent and scope of violence children experience.  The systematic review assessed 127 studies carried out in the region since 2015, as well as conducting analyses using 7 datasets on school related violence.  Data from cross-sectional studies show that approximately half of all children report experiencing some type of physical violence during their lifetime – this can be from parents/caregivers in the form of violent discipline or from teachers, intimate partners or peers. Over a quarter (27.8%) to nearly half (47.6%) of children experience more severe forms of physical punishment by caregivers/mothers in three out of four of the countries in the region where this is comparably measured.
 In all countries in the region the prevalence of physical attacks, (based on the Global School Based Health Survey (GSHS) among adolescents is higher than the global median, one to two thirds of boys have experienced being physically attacked in the past year and nearly a  quarter to half of girls have been physically attacked at some point in the past year.
 Approximately 9–14% – or 1 in 10 children – report experiencing sexual violence in childhood, although this is likely to be an underestimation of the true prevalence due to lack population-based prevalence data.  Studies in the region also show that witnessing violence, either between parents or between known adults, is frequently reported by children. Emotional violence is prevalent throughout the region and is almost always present when other types of violence are measured, suggesting that all forms of violence against children contain elements of emotional violence within the South Asia region.
 Bullying is prevalent in the South Asia region and gender dynamics are complex across countries. In all countries that measure comparable data on school violence and bullying (7 out of the 8 countries in the region), among adolescents aged 13–15, boys experience more bullying overall (except in Afghanistan), more physical bullying (except in Pakistan), more physical attacks and more physical fighting than girls. Both boys and girls experience an approximately similar amount of exclusionary bullying, while more girls in the region experience bullying based on physical appearance.
Children in the region also experience conflict related violence with several countries in South Asia report some of the highest student and educator-targeted attacks (killings, abductions, and threats) globally. According to the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA), student and educator-targeted attacks in Afghanistan were among the most prevalent in the world, and among countries in the South Asia region, Afghanistan experienced the most attacks on schools (300) between 2017–2019, followed by Pakistan with 50 attacks and India with 43 attacks.
The consequences of violence against children in South Asia are profound and long-lasting, impacting children’s physical health, mental health, behavior and educational impacts. Suicide ideation linked with bullying experiences ranged from 41.8% of bullied adolescents in Bhutan to a high of 63.1% of adolescents in Nepal. This is quite significant when we look at actual adolescent suicide rates in the Southeast Asia region where self-harm is the leading cause of death among adolescent girls and the second leading cause of death among adolescent boys (WHO 2012).   Data demonstrates the link between violence against children and negative educational outcomes, which has significant implications for the future of the region.  Evidence in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan shows that experiencing corporal punishment in school is highly related to having poor educational outcomes and test scores and is a factor in school dropout.


[1] South Asia region covers 8 countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Key Assignments/Tasks:


Adapt costing models used in UNICEF EAPRO and UNICEF Nigeria to the South Asia context with focus on the health, mental health and educational consequences of child maltreatment and losses in life years from specific conditions, to determine the economic cost of violence against children to the region.
Methodology
This study will estimate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for various costs and consequences of violence against children, apply the regional costing model to estimate minimum lifetime costs of violence against children in South Asia, and estimate the economic burden that violence against children will bring to public budgets and society. The specific steps of the study are:

Briefing and research planning meeting (remotely) among the consultant and UNICEF South Asia: to review and agree on the study plan and suggested methodology.
Desk review of available data: to ensure the research team is highly familiar with relevant and existing research on violence in South Asia including the Violence against Children in South Asia systematic review of evidence since 2015 as a foundational document, and additional relevant documentation including the India DHS 2019-2020, Bangladesh DHS 2017-2018, Nepal MICS 2019, etc.
Calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) by type of violence: based on available data, primarily data from systematic review and other key data sets available, information needed for the calculation of PAFs will be extracted and compiled into a data set for analysis. PAFs will be estimated by major type of violence against children (physical violence, emotional violence, sexual violence, and witnessing violence in the home and community), the overlap between types of violence against children, and for each of the major categories of impact. These categories are: 1) effects on education, 2) effects on mental health and behaviour, 3) effects on physical health, sexual behaviour and substance use, and 4) effects on intimate partner violence perpetration and revictimization (where data is sufficient). The PAF is an epidemiologic concept which is widely used to attribute the proportion of morbidity or mortality to a risk factor. All PAF formulas required two pieces of data: 1) relative risk (RR) of a disease or outcome (e.g., depression) given exposure to a risk factors (e.g., child sexual abuse); and 2) and appropriate measure of prevalence. Three steps will be applied to estimate PAFs: 1) estimate the prevalence of violence against children for each major type of violence; 2) estimate violence against children – outcome relationships for each type of violence and each selected outcome; and 3) use the standard formula to calculate population attributable fractions.
Apply the regional costing model to the South Asia context: PAFs represent a proportion and are scaled from 0.0-1.0. For translation into public health policy and communication to stakeholders, PAFs are multiplied by a measure of total burden (e.g., deaths, DALYs, or economic costs) to estimate the burden that is responsible to the risk factors. For example, a PAF of 0.4 would imply a 40% of the burden attributable to the risk factor. If the total burden is $100 million, then $40 million is attributable to the risk factor.

Accurate estimates of both the PAF and the total burden figure are essential when estimating the share of burden due to a risk factor. Therefore, data availability and appropriate levels of aggregation must be considered when deciding about the types of measures of total burden to multiply by the estimated PAFs. The burden must be matched as closely as possible to the evidence underlying the PAF. For this study, two different estimates of total burden will be used to provide multiple measures of the burden of violence against children in South Asia:

DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). The non-fatal burden of health from child maltreatment is substantial. DALYs formally capture this by adding together morbidity and mortality. Morbidity is defined in terms of years lived with “disability” (YLD)—reduced health—and mortality in terms of years of life lost (YLL) relative to the expected lifespan. DALYs are widely used in international health comparisons and may be especially valuable as a common metric. DALY estimates from the WHO will be used.
Economic costs. Economic costs are a desirable measure since they are influential for policymakers. The DALY estimates will be monetized to indirectly estimate the costs of morbidity (and mortality). Regarding the estimate of the value of a DALY, this study will use the method taken by WHO (2001), Brown (2008), and others, which assumes that a year lost to disability (YLD) is equal to the country’s per-capita GDP; in other words, this is a “human capital” approach to valuing YLDs.


Calculation of the costing of violence against children using the model described above: using prevalence data the model shall be used to estimate the costing upon different assumptions about true lifetime prevalence.
Technical meetings (remote) among the research team, UNICEF South Asia and expert group: conducting at least two meetings with UNICEF South Asia and expert group: one to discuss the proposed methodology and one at the end of the study to review the preliminary findings.
Presentation of findings in a research report and presentation format.

Deliverables:
Desk review of available literature including the VAC South Asia systematic review and other key data sets
Draft research concept note including detailed methodology
Presentation of the concept note/methodology to expert group and UNICEF ROSA, based on input finalise
Application of the economic costing model, data analysis and drafting of report

For every child,
BACKGROUNGUNICEF CO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) in the development of innovative mechanisms to ensure the continuity of learning for every child and adolescent in the country during COVID 19 pandemic. The immediate action after analysis of connectivity in Tajikistan is to support schools by using TV to connect students and educators for uninterrupted home learning. The effort of reimagining learning outside of the traditional classroom requires a close collaboration between UNICEF and MoES as well as the development of instructional, content, technology and institutional agreements. Therefore, the task is to support in the design and production of a total of 2045 TV lessons as an alternative education delivery system for all subjects. It entails reviewing existing quality resources, best teaching practices, analysis of capacities and context and establishing appropriate monitoring systems for response including data collection and analysis. The first development of TV lessons for grade 9-11 has been completed as part of the immediate response, launched during May-July 2020. As a result, a total of 120 lessons have been developed and broadcasted in national TV with the financial support of the European Union. The remaining 1885 lessons are to be developed covering all grades and subjects of national curriculum.
In Tajikistan, educational institutions including primary schools, high schools, and kindergartens closed their doors in April 2020 following confirmation of the country’s first COVID-19 cases. Over two million school children in Tajikistan were out of school for around one and a half months. Throughout this time, UNICEF Tajikistan, the EU, and the Government of Tajikistan worked behind-the-scenes to produce home learning resources and ensure a safe and enabling learning environment for when children returned to school.
To facilitate the continuation of learning outside the formal school setting amid the pandemic, UNICEF and the MoES worked together to develop a series of TV lessons, that supported students to learn the subjects, based on the general education curricula, and also included guidelines and tools for distance learning for teachers, students and parents. TV lessons connected students and educators, addressing the lack of internet connectivity and remoteness of villages and households in the Republic of Tajikistan.
Currently, as part of the sustainability strategy of the distance learning module, UNICEF is planning to launch the creative studio for in-house video-lessons production by teachers and media center for schoolchildren activate student councils in one school as pilot. The creative studio and media center will be equipped with the video-production and other teaching and learning equipment and software and also have an ergonomic and child-friendly design.
To meet this requirement, UNICEF would like to invite a capable individual, who will provide below services:
1)  Development of the list for video-production, software and audio production equipment to be purchased for creative studios with technical specifications;
2)  Development of interior design concepts for 2 creative studios and provision of their 3D model visualization;

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
Background
For the past 25 years, UNICEF has been a strategic and trusted partner of the Government of Turkmenistan, working closely to support the implementation of child rights and promote equity. In line with national development priorities, UNICEF has provided technical assistance to improve legislation and policies, capacity development of public institutions and support to families to better care for their children. Within the framework of the ongoing Turkmenistan-UNICEF Country Programme for the period 2016–2020, UNICEF supports the Government of Turkmenistan to accelerate the universal realization of child rights by aligning legal frameworks, policies and practices for children with international standards. Turkmenistan is a signatory to major treaties, conventions and declarations related to rights of children, including the Convention of the Rights of the Child.  In recent years the country has made considerable progress in implementation and reporting of international treaties.
 
Turkmenistan ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 September 1993 and submitted its first report in 2006, in 2020 Turkmenistan has submitted its combined 5-6 periodic report. Taking into account that in 2017 in Turkmenistan was created the Office of Ombudsman (OO) and quite a number of information has been collected by the office, Office of Ombudsman decided to develop and submit to CRC its first alternative report.
 
The country made a very good progress regarding some recommendations, such as the adoption of the National Plan of Action for Realisation of Child Rights in 2018 and establishment of an independent human rights institution - Ombudsman.  Discussions on the development of the first alternative report have started with the Office of Ombudsman in 2020 and it was agreed to pilot it in 2021.
 
Considering, that alternative report is submitted after the State Report, which was in October 2020, the expected deadline for the alternative report is to be identified, as per the https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/TreatyBodyExternal/SessionsList.aspx?Treaty=CRC.
 
Ready to support the efforts of OO Turkmenistan to use the CRC reporting as a process of in-depth stock-taking and strengthening the national capacity to monitor and respond to child rights, and applying participatory approaches and innovative techniques for data collection on alternative report, UNICEF will provide technical assistance to support OO to plan and submit the alternative report.  
Purpose of the assignment
Given the above context and taking into consideration the submission of the next regular state report in 2020 to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UN CRC), UNICEF in Turkmenistan is going to engage an international consultant to support Office of Ombudsman in preparation of its first alternative report to the UN CRC.
Specific Tasks

Review periodic reports of the Office of Ombudsman and identify potential use for the alternative report on CRC
Review State Report to CRC and inputs of Ombudsman there, to avoid duplications in the alternative report and identify gaps, that could be covered in the alternative report of the Office of Ombudsman
Develop draft plan for the preparation of the alternative report and potential additional sources of information/data collection for the report
Review legislation review done for the State CRC report and suggest potential up-date or use for the alternative report
Review the matrix developed by UNICEF in 2017 for a quick assessment of the status of the 2015 CRC recommendations in consultation with the Government partner.
Develop plan of actions for additional data collection and relevant documentation (questionnaires for interviews, structure of focus group or any other, as deem necessary)
Support the facilitation of an initial workshop with the OO, CSOs, Private sector and Academia to provide up-to-date information on the alternative reporting requirements. The workshop will discuss identified gaps in information in the State CRC report and potential enrichment of this information through the alternative report.
Support with organisation of inclusive consultations and engagement of all the stakeholders, including CSOs and children.
Support with engaging children and children with disabilities into the alternative report preparation, develop questionnaires or apply existing. Conduct on-line sessions with children
Support the facilitation of a second workshop that will focus on the review of draft parts of the report and discussion on potential improvements
Help bring out interlinkages between the 2030 Agenda and human rights reporting and support the analysis of achievement of national child-related SDG indicators and country’s progress in terms of the ‘Leave No-one behind’ principle
Provide advice and technical support from distance during the report drafting stage, as needed.
Help UNICEF plan its further support to the alternative reporting process.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, results
Between 2014 and 2018, some 1.3 million children sought international protection in Europe, fleeing conflict, insecurity and lack of opportunities in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and in countries in sub-Saharan Eastern and Western Africa. They include over 225,000 unaccompanied and separated children - the majority of whom are adolescent boys (15-17 years old), as well as an estimated 500,000 infants and children under the age of five.
Countries in Southern and South-Eastern Europe have been at the forefront in receiving children on the move over the past few years. In 2018 alone, some 141,600 refugees and migrants undertook treacherous sea and land journeys to reach Greece, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain in the hope of safety, protection and better opportunities for themselves and their families. This included some 30,000 children, over a third of whom (12,700) were either making the journey alone or became separated from their families while en route.
Despite measures to prevent irregular migration, Mediterranean routes, particularly in the East and West, continue to see a significant number of new arrivals and an increase in the proportion of children. As of June 2019, some 42,000 refugee and migrant children were present in reception facilities in Greece, Italy and the Balkans.
The circumstances encountered by refugee and migrant children before, during and after displacement and migration severely impact their health outcomes. In countries of origin, the widespread breakdown of health systems and health services often result in children being inadequately protected from vaccine-preventable diseases. Crowded and unhygienic living conditions in transit and in destinations further increase their risks of acquiring bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Skin and eye infections (e.g., scabies and conjunctivitis) and upper respiratory tract infections are often identified among refugee and migrant children rescued at sea.
The 24-month ‘RM Child-Health’ initiative, which began in January 2020, aims to help improve the health of children on the move in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Serbia. With European Union funding support, under the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety, UNICEF is working with its partners on the ground to implement tailored interventions to address critical gaps and bottlenecks with regards to healthcare provision by national authorities and policy implementation, which impact refugee and migrant children’s health status, in the following four areas:

Primary health care, including immunization,
Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS),
Gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response,
Maternal and child health, including infant and young children feeding (MCH and IYCF).

All interventions are being designed in line with human rights principles and standards and build on existing cooperation frameworks between UNICEF and Governments (Country Programme Documents) in Project countries, ongoing activities within the UNICEF refugee and migrant response in Europe, and commitments under its Strategic Plan 2018-2021. The project pursues the following three objectives:

Strengthening national authorities’ capacity to provide healthcare to refugee and migrant children,
Increasing health literacy among refugee and migrant children and their parents,
Strengthening implementation of national health policies.

 
 
How can you make a difference?
UNICEF ECARO is seeking a Consultant to provide guidance and sound technical advice to Project Focal Points, and support to authorities to address relevant policy/procedural bottlenecks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Serbia, with the aim to strengthen implementation of national health policies. He/she will develop country specific, gender sensitive policy briefs and advocacy packages, aimed at removing procedural or administrative barriers that prevent or limit refugee and migrant children’s access to primary and specialized health services. The consultant will also develop a regional policy brief to capture promising practices from Project countries and outline key recommendations for the improvement of refugee and migrant children's health status in Project countries and beyond, eventually contributing to the final regional assessment report of the Project.
Methodology
The consultant will initiate discussions with Country Office staff, facilitate focus group discussions, and will be expected to use a combination of different analytical techniques, tools and processes as appropriate given the specific contexts and data availability, to identify the main bottlenecks and barriers.
Specific Objectives

Hold initial discussions with project offices to define ways of working and level of support needs;
Review existing policy frameworks, information related to provision of essential service, standard operational guidelines and best practices aimed at strengthening RMC Health status. (This includes, but is not limited to, specific evidence collected through participation in the cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms; project implementation documents such as service providers mappings, analysis of standards of care, standard operating procedures, referral pathways; and experiences in evidence-based advocacy for targeted interventions (e.g. catch-up vaccination campaigns, referral of children and adolescents showing signs of psychosocial distress or mental health issues and survivors of GBV).
Support Country Offices in documenting these efforts, identifying key bottlenecks for effective service provision and developing the country specific policy-advocacy brief. The consultant will help offices to identify commonalities and differences between the contexts, and foster exchanges on lessons learned and good practices between project countries. The cross-sectoral approaches will be promoted to respond to refugee and migrant children’s health needs in a holistic and integrated manner.
The Consultant will develop a regional policy brief capturing lessons learned and promising thematic practices emerging from the Project. The brief will inform broad recommendations to strengthen the health status of refugee and migrant children in Project countries and Europe more broadly. Its findings and recommendations will feed the regional assessment report (including country-specific chapters) and guide further regional advocacy and national system-building approaches.

En coopération avec le Gouvernement et en consultation avec l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies et ses partenaires, l'UNICEF a élaboré un programme de coopération en alignement du Plan de Développement Economique et Social du Gouvernement 2017-2021 et du Plan-cadre des Nations Unies pour l'aide au développement (UNDAF) 2019-2021. Ce programme qui œuvre pour la pleine réalisation des droits de l'enfant et la réduction des disparités, opère à travers son bureau-pays établi à Niamey et ses quatre bureaux de zone (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi et Tahoua) et ses 6 composantes de programme que sont : la Santé, la Nutrition, l’Education, la Protection de l'enfant, les Adolescents & Normes Sociales et l’Inclusion Sociale.
La région de Diffa, où intervient le Bureau de Zone, est une zone de conflit qui subit les conséquences de la crise du Bassin du Lac Tchad depuis 2015. Cette crise est à l’origine de déplacements de population qui fragilisent davantage une région parmi les plus démunies et enclavées du Niger. La région fait face également a des catastrophes naturelles majeurs, comme les inondations, et une crise nutritionnelle particulièrement aiguë.
Le bureau de zone intervient pour appuyer les efforts du gouvernement pour les interventions de développement visant la réduction de la pauvreté et l’assistance humanitaire aux multiples crises affectant la région. C’est dans cette optique, qu’UNICEF compte recruter un Programme Associate pour faciliter la mise en œuvre du programme en soutien au Chef de Bureau et aux chargés de programme.  Le profil du poste est décrit dans paragraphes qui suivent.

 Digital Communication Officer -- Social Media Editor, Division of Communication, UNICEF NYHQ
 UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, results
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does -- in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children's rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life -- in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions -- her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society's most disadvantaged citizens -- addressing inequity -- not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
This position resides within the Digital Strategy Section, as part of the Division of Communication and reports directly to the Head of Social Media Campaigns and Supporter Engagement. The Digital Strategy Section manages all global digital channels and digital communications for UNICEF, including unicef.org in 5 UN languages, and global social media channels.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Research
The Office of Research-Innocenti is the dedicated research office of UNICEF. It undertakes and commissions research on emerging or current issues of relevance for children in order to inform the strategic directions, policies and programmes of UNICEF and its partners. The office explores emerging issues, identifies research gaps, and brings together existing researchers to support or undertake new research, data collection and analysis to address critical questions. The Research Facilitation & Knowledge Management unit within which this internship is located plays a leading role in building a knowledge culture across UNICEF and beyond by providing essential guidance and tools to strengthen generation, communication and use of evidence in decision-making.
The purpose of this position is for an intern to assist the Best of UNICEF Research project manager with the 2021 exercise.
‘Best of UNICEF Research’ is an annual competition undertaken by Innocenti since 2012 to collect, share and recognise the research that takes place within UNICEF. Research in UNICEF is carried out and commissioned by Country Offices, Regions, Headquarters and, increasingly, by National Committees and is often undertaken with external partners.
This annual exercise calls upon all relevant sections of UNICEF to submit their best examples of high-quality research carried out either directly by UNICEF or with partners and completed in the past two years. Specifically, as part of this exercise, Innocenti is interested in receiving research that is:
• Likely to have an impact on national, regional or global policies for children, including national strategies and legal frameworks;• Innovative and explores how programmes on the ground can be enhanced towards improved results, with respect to equity, effectiveness and efficiency, and the participation of children; • Contributes to national, regional or global advocacy efforts in a way that has shifted programme horizons or explores a neglected area of children’s lives deserving of further inquiry; and• Developing a robust or innovative methodology.
Innocenti screens all submissions for eligibility and assesses them according to standard criteria. A shortlist of the highest rated pieces (approx. 10) is shared with an external review panel, who identify the top pieces deserving of recognition. An annual publication is then produced, highlighting the research of all finalists.
2. OBJECTIVES
This internship is to support the ‘Best of UNICEF Research 2021’ exercise. The intern will assist the Best of UNICEF Research (BOUR) project manager, based in the Research Facilitation and Knowledge Management team and other UNICEF-Innocenti colleagues in the overall management of the exercise including keeping track of all entries, allocating reviewers to different research pieces, updating the project database, providing regular updates to entrants, supporting the screening and assessment of the submitted research, supporting co-ordination of a publication on the top submissions, identifying promotional opportunities for the publication, including on social media and writing a ‘facts & figures’ document based on information collected from the submissions at the end of the exercise.The intern will be supported to strengthen and demonstrate good project management and organisational skills.

Advert: ToR/2021/02
International Individual/ International Institution: 
International Consultant to facilitate the development of Country Programme Document (CPD) 2022 – 2026.
Purpose of assignment & Background:
UNICEF Maldives Country Office (MCO), in collaboration with national partners, wishes to develop Country Program of Cooperation between the Government of Maldives (GoM) and UNICEF.
During the last four decades, the Maldives witnessed massive economic development and social transformation. The country steadily moved from a least-developed country to an upper middle-income country. Primary school enrolment moved from 15% to 96%, life expectancy increased by 30 years, and child and maternal mortality reduced from 48 and 200 to 9 and 44, respectively. However, many of the remote islands did not have an equal share of socioeconomic development while new social and health challenges started to emerge among children and young people. While some children suffer from stunting, many others are obese. Drug use, violence, against children, increase in crimes committed by children, and low levels of employment among young people are growing concerns. Given the unique small island state nature of Maldives, climate change and environmental protection are two key challenges that threaten the very existence of the over 1,190 islands of Maldives.
The country introduced many important national strategies, policies and programs. For instance, the country introduced a national social protection program and established the National Social Protection Agency (NSPA) to ensure social inclusion and protection, established a non-contributory national health insurance program that covers all citizens, developed a new child-centered national curriculum and is providing free education up to tertiary level, and developed a national strategy for drug prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration for children and young people.
Maldives’ economy has been negatively impacted as a consequence of  the COVID-19 situation and high debt (2020). The impact of climate change felt over the past few decades affecting the social indicators in the country can not be underestimated. Maldives is at crossroads in its development with both opportunities and challenges as highlighted above.
The current program of cooperation (CPD 2016 – 2021) had to be extended for one year due to the global pandemic on COVID-19. Initial preparation for the development of the new country program document was already underway with the situation analysis (SitAn). The SitAn is currently undergoing a revision and being updated to reflect the impact of COVID-19. We expect to conclude the SitAn by the end of March to move ahead with the development of the CPD.  The development of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2022-2026 for Maldives is also currently well underway.
The process of developing the cooperation framework and country programme is directly guided by the Government Strategic Action Plan (SAP 2019 – 2023) and National Resilience and Recovery 2020 – 2021.
Purpose of the assignment 
In order to align to the Government Strategic Action Plan (SAP 2019 – 2023) and National Resilience and Recovery 2020 – 2021 the UNSDCF and the UNICEF Maldives CPD were both extended by one year up to 31 December 2021. UNICEF is preparing the next CP, in close consultation with Government, UN and other partners, which will run from 2022 to 2026. The CP is developed in tandem with UN agencies working on the next UNSDCF development,  the UNICEF new Strategic Plan 2022-2026 (Pending) and Agenda 2030 - Decade of action-SDGs.
This terms of reference (ToR) focuses on the purpose, scope and process for elaborating a new human rights-based, SDG-centered, equity and life-cycle-focused, gender-sensitive and risk-informed Country Programme Document (CPD) for the Republic of Maldives.

For every child, 

Since 2015, Greece has seen over 1,200,000 migrants arriving on its territory both through its land and sea borders, including migrants in a situation of vulnerability such as Unaccompanied Migrant Children (UMC). Given that legal pathways facilitating mobility out of the country are either extremely limited (e.g. bilateral relocation schemes) or are realized only after the completion of lengthy procedures (i.e. family reunion under the Dublin Regulation) and whereas arrivals continue on a stable basis, the already overstretched national reception system has been struggling to respond to the needs of over 120,000 refugees and migrants in Greece, either living under inappropriate conditions or remaining in limbo in regard to their future.
UNICEF became operational in Greece in early 2016 as an outposted team from the Regional Office of Europe and Central Asia (ECARO) to respond to the significant influx of refugee and migrant children and their families at that time. The response centered on a two-track approach covering direct service delivery as well as national capacity building through critical partnerships with governmental bodies, ministries, local authorities, civil society and NGOs and focused primarily on three main strategic sectors – child protection, education and child rights monitoring.
Following several years of engagement with national stakeholders, UNICEF and the Government of Greece made a decision in January 2020 to formalize the agency’s presence in the country under the form of a Greece Country Office. This office falls under the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia located in Geneva, which supports the work of 21 Country Offices within its geographical scope, reporting in turn to global headquarters in New York.
Since September 2020, UNICEF has expanded its programme in Lesvos responding to the emergency needs of refugee and migrant children and their families. Specifically, UNICEF is leading the WASH sector response for the new RIC site in Lesvos and coordinating efforts to ensure access to services (education, GBV prevention/response and child protection).

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

Background
In West and Central Africa Region, and specifically in its Sahelian zone, and protracted emergency countries regularly affected by nutrition crisis, high levels of stunting and wasting are negatively impacting on child survival and development. UNICEF is playing a lead role in the prevention and care of all forms of malnutrition to achieve the 2030 World Health Assembly and SDG goals. Nutrition is a key priority of UNICEF agenda in West and Central Africa, as reflected in the Key Result for Children # 2 (Prevention of stunting). 
Nutrition and Supply teams, both at regional and country level are joining efforts to develop robust nutrition supply chains, as a key component to achieve programmatic goals. 
To respond to programmatic objectives, UNICEF has developed and strengthened nutrition supply chains over the past decade. With an average of 1.2 million cartons a year, Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) became the most distributed commodity in the region, representing the highest value and volume for a single item, resulting both in financial risks and logistics challenges
In most countries, Nutrition Supply Chain has been established in parallel of national health supply chains. The appropriation by and accountability of national counterparts; as well as the ability to monitor and report are common and significant bottlenecks identified across the region. Additionally, one of the key elements will be to define role and accountabilities of each stakeholder within the supply chain until the last mile beneficiary. 
Country offices are accountable for identifying the supply chain fundamentals and for accompanying capacity development strategy needed for UNICEF supply and program staff to achieve the goals of the country program document, the UNICEF Strategic Plan, and the SDGs. 
From 2019 and 2020, the Regional Office engaged with nutrition stakeholders in the above-mentioned countries to focus on End User Monitoring issues (including setting qualitative and qualitative indicators on supply availability and service delivery; developing data collection tools and rolling out the project). This resulted in 4 case studies documenting the experience.  Additionally, support was provided for establishing an integration road map using the maturity model. ECHO and DFID are directly supporting this initiative.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Research
The Office of Research-Innocenti (OoR-Innocenti) is the dedicated research office of UNICEF. It undertakes and commissions research on emerging or current issues of relevance for children in order to inform the strategic directions, policies and programmes of UNICEF, Governments and their partners. The Office explores emerging issues, identifies research gaps, brings together existing researchers, and supports or undertakes research and data collection to address critical questions and to inform policy dialogue and implementation at country level.
Education is a key focus of UNICEF Innocenti, with research on education and learning to support the implementation of best practices for education systems, policies and programmes. Working with UNICEF Headquarters, regional and country offices as well as universities and international partners, the education team supports 50+ countries worldwide in conducting evidence-based reviews and field research.
Activities in the READ (Research on Education And Development) unit are carried out in six main streams:
a) Teacher motivation, attendance and of time on task (‘Time to Teach’ project)‘Time to Teach’, one of READ team’s research projects, focuses on the determinants of teacher motivation, attendance and of time on task in 20 countries across Africa, influencing national policy and building national capacities in mixed-methods research through in-country training. ‘Time to teach’ is so far active in East and Southern Africa, West and Central Africa and Morocco.
b) Positive deviant practices and behaviors at school level (Data Must Speak project)Since 2019, in line with UNICEF Foundational Learning and Numeracy (FLN) Programme, Data Must Speak (DMS) identifies positive deviant schools (i.e. schools that outperform others in terms of learning, equity and retention even though they operate with equivalent resources and contexts). The research explores why those positive deviant schools are outperforming others and investigates how these behaviors/practices could be optimally scaled in lower performing schools. DMS is demand-driven and uses a co-creation and co-implementation mixed-methods approach combining quantitative, qualitative and participatory implementation research as well as behavioral and scaling science, to improve uptake, replicability and sustainability. The research is so far undertaken in ten countries in Asia and Africa.
c) Digital learning (Learning Passport and Akelius projects)The digital learning programme investigates the development, implementation and effectiveness of digital learning across various settings (no/low/high connectivity), modalities of use (blended/remote learning), populations, and education goals. Building mixed methods research into large scale digital learning partnerships such as the UNICEF-Akelius foundation partnership and the Learning Passport provides evidence on how to operationalize Reimagine Educations goal of delivering world class digital learning solutions to marginalized children. Currently research is being undertaken with digital learning in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Greece, Lebanon, Mauritania, Serbia and Timor Leste. d) Girls’ and marginalized children’s education (Let Us Learn (LUL) project)The LUL project investigates how innovations in education delivery can increase opportunities to access and improve learning for the most marginalized children with a specific focus on girls. LUL programme and mixed methods research is undertaken in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Liberia, Madagascar and Nepal.
e) Early Childhood Education (including in reference to COVID-19)The early years of a child’s life are critical to building the foundations of learning that help them succeed in school and beyond. READ is establishing a new research portfolio focused on early childhood education. Priority activities for this year include an evidence review of what works, how and in what context, in improving equitable access to and learning quality in pre-primary education. The team is also developing and trialing resources to support parents and caregivers of children with disabilities during remote learning.
f) Sport for Development (S4D project)In countries around the world, sport, recreation and play are improving the health and well-being of children and youth. Sport for development (S4D) organizations harness the power of sport as an inclusive mean of helping children to improve their health; to develop their social, educational and leadership skills; to empower them; and of course, to play and have fun. S4D protects children’s right to play while contributing towards the Social Development Goals. Our research, in partnership with the Barca Foundation investigates the best practices that Sport for Development (S4D) organizations could follow to ensure optimal child outcomes in terms of education, health, empowerment, protection and life skills.

For every child, Development
Background and Justification 
South Africa is a major destination for children on the move from countries throughout Eastern and Southern Africa.  South Africa is a country of contrast, with wide socio-economic inequalities between children and communities. Despite some of the strongest economic opportunities in Southern Africa, South Africa still faces high levels of crime and violence and large populations living in informal settlements without access to basic infrastructure or services.
The Department of Social Development has set up a national taskforce on unaccompanied and separated children. The latter oversees and guides the implementation of an interdepartmental plan of action to address some of the above gaps. In partnership with service providers throughout the country, joint commitment has been demonstrated to finding solutions to the complex problems faced by these extremely vulnerable children.  Yet the reality for many children on the move in South Africa remains that their life continues to be a struggle for survival in the margins of society with an uncertain future – and as such, urgent action is further needed. 
Global Promotion of Best Practices for Children in Migration” supported by  DSD, European Union (EU) and UNICEF 
This global project will be implemented in four countries: Mexico, El Salvador, Zambia and South Africa. The duration of the project is thirty (30) months, starting from 20th October, 2020, and ending on 20th April, 2023. The overall objective of the project in these four countries is: that children on the move are effectively protected and their rights are being realized.
In South Africa, the National Department of Social Development with support from it’s Provincial offices,  is the lead agency to implement the project with support from EU and UNICEF. In support of the implementation of the project, DSD will work with some civil society organizations to complement some of the activities under the project in provinces linking with other government services for children on the move in South Africa.
The project will directly affect and engage with 1) duty bearers at a regional, national, provincial, district and community level and media; 2) public frontline officers and staff (police, civic and immigration officers, social workers, etc.), 3) providers of services (such as civil society organizations, and alternative care providers) 4) key stakeholders such as other UN Organizations, like IOM/UNHCR and other international organizations. The direct target group include the rights holders themselves (i.e. children and adolescents who are on the move or in mixed migration).
The project will mainly provide for activities such as technical assistance to national authorities to develop a multi-sectoral standard operating procedures (SOP) for integrated services, to issue directives and to implement the case management system (including developing cross border case management mechanisms) for children on the move. The activities also include support to DSD’s response to children on the move through the national Steering Committee on Unacompanied and Separated Migrant Children (UASM), supporting UNHCR’s led Best Interest Determination (BID) procedures and capacity building to public officers and frontline workers (social service professionals, police, border officials, immigration officers); support to improve mental health referral pathways; expansion of community-based psychosocial support; strengthening family and community-based care options for children on the move increase access to services such as birth registration, training of social service professionals on how to work with children on the move.
This consultancy will focus on project management to strengthen the capacity at DSD to guide, oversee, manage and steer the implementation of the project, organize advisory board and other meetings, tracking progress, liaison between DSD and UNICEF, liaison with civil society and other partners at all levels. 
Scope of Work

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
Background
In line with the Government’s national development plans, sectoral priorities and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2021-2025, the new UNICEF Country Programme will include a stronger focus on exclusion and inequalities with a vision to realise the rights of every child. The 2021-2025 Child Protection Programme has been conceptualized with consideration of UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and two strategic priorities on effective governance and justice for all, and Inclusive human capital development leading to health, well-being and resilient prosperity. These align with Outcomes 1 and 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework of Uzbekistan, which are fully aligned with national priorities to support the Government to achieve the national SDGs.
The long-term vision for change in the area of child protection is to ensure that by 2025, the most vulnerable children, including children from disadvantaged and low-income families, children at early ages and those with disabilities benefit from a protective environment that prevents separation of children from families and deprivation of liberty, and effectively responds to violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect.
In 2019, UNICEF in partnership with the larger EU-funded cross-regional project ‘Protecting children affected by migration in Southeast, South and Central Asia’ has conducted a study on ‘Effects of migration on children of Uzbekistan’. The study report findings show that in Uzbekistan, children left behind often stay with their extended family members, with adult relatives acting as caregivers, when one or both parents migrate. Such children may face developmental, psychosocial and emotional challenges, since the absence of parents creates disruptions and displacement in care giving arrangements. Parental migration has detrimental effects on the education, health and social status of children as well. It can lead to early adulting of the child due to increased household duties and responsibilities which can affect eating habits, academic performance and cause depression. The full study report on ‘Effects of migration on children in Uzbekistan’, UNICEF (2019) is available at: https://www.unicef.org/uzbekistan/en/reports/study-report-effects-migration-children-uzbekistan
One of the lessons learned from the previous Country Programme is that to make further progress in realising children's rights, there is a need to measure the impact of national policies, plans and services on the most disadvantaged families and children. Stronger national monitoring capacity will help build the accountable systems needed to adjust to rapid changes, including in crisis situations, such as seen with the COVID-19 pandemic.
UNICEF is aware that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children goes far beyond any health risks. Measures used to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus can for example expose children to additional protection risks. Disruptions to families, friendships, schooling and the wider community can have negative consequences on children’s well-being, development and protection. In this context, in May 2020, ENOC and UNICEF conducted a short online survey on Ombudspersons and Commissioners for Children’s responses to the new challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently organized an online discussion. 
Following up on the above and the ongoing collaboration, UNICEF ECARO proposes to further partner with ENOC to support national child rights mechanisms to assess key identified areas and specific vulnerable groups of children including those in institutional care, in detention/closed institutions, affected by violence involved in child labour, and affected by migration. Through this cooperation project, UNICEF will support ENOC to provide direct technical assistance (through webinars, and bi-lateral quality assurance) to a number of Ombudspersons for Children’s Offices in Europe and Central Asia for the undertaking and completing of specific Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIAs) related to COVID-19  including the Child Rights Ombudsman  of Uzbekistan for the undertaking and completing of specific Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIAs) related to COVID-19. ENOC will develop a Common Framework of Reference (CFR) and will train and guide the National Ombudspersons, on the methodology of the Assessment and assure the quality of the reporting. 
Objectives
The Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIA) will enable the Child Rights Ombudsman office in Uzbekistan (CRO) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on children affected by migration (i.e. left behind by migrant parents). This initiative will strengthen the overall capacities of the CRO in monitoring child rights. The assessment will contribute to lessons learnt for the decision-makers to ensure better preparedness and capability to respond effectively to a similar challenge in the future. The findings of the CRIA will allow the CRO to dialogue with the Government of Uzbekistan to inform their respective processes with regard to child rights.
UNICEF in Uzbekistan will support the CRO to strengthen their capacities in conducting a CRIA as a contribution to the overall UNICEF ECARO-ENOC initiative. To this end, UNICEF Uzbekistan Office is looking for a qualified individual consultant to provide their professional expertise in support of the CRIA exercise.

 BACKGROUND 
The mission and goal of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) program in Guinea-Bissau is to contribute to the overall realization of the National Health Development Plan (PNDS) by reducing morbidity, mortality and disability due to vaccine preventable diseases and to ensure all children and high-risk group are fully vaccinated with high quality and effective vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases as per national and global standards. To achieve these goals, routine immunization services for children and pregnant women are provided through static, outreach and mobile sites and occasional special acceleration campaigns.
Immunization is the most widely accessed and successful child health intervention in use today in Guinea Bissau. But immunization coverage has stagnated at 88% of DPT3 over the last five years (WUENIC 2019), which is probably related to the general instability context resulting in the erosion of public services and systems. Also, these relative high rates mask inequities at the subnational level. At subnational level, 3 out of 11 regions has the DTP3 coverage less than 80 per cent in 2020. Around 8,000 children remained unvaccinated in Guinea-Bissau during 2019, more in 2020 with the COVID-19 context. More than 60% of those unvaccinated children are living in urban area, principally in the capital Bissau.
The study on equity in immunization conducted in 2017 showed that the major bottlenecks to immunization are: geographical access; continuity in use; quality of services, except for Bissau where the issues are quite different, more related to human resources capacity and economic activities of mothers. The study also helped identify underserved communities in each region for which specific efforts must be undertaken to reach every child. Major challenges remain in terms of insufficient allocation of human resources, coordination, outreach strategies, cold chain management and data collection.
Strategies to reach unvaccinated children have been developed and are being implemented.
To improve the amount, quality and use of available immunization data, Gavi launched and is implemented with country partners a strategic focus area for data that address three key areas:

Immunization delivery, coverage and equity: strengthening the quality of immunization coverage data to help address bottlenecks.
Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance: helping countries to strengthen their surveillance systems and use disease data to target and improve immunization programmes. VPD surveillance systems are also a vital part of ensuring global health security and outbreak preparedness.
Vaccine safety surveillance and response: establishing and improving data systems to detect adverse events and implement effective response and communication strategies.

Through their assistance, Vaccine Alliance partners are supporting new ways to use data to inform immunization programmes. This includes the production of various immunization coverage and equity analyses as well as targeted support for data improvement plans.
UNICEF is at the forefront of supporting the MOH in immunization data management, ensuring that all children are equitably reached, and would like to recruit three experienced national consultants to provide a technical insight to the country’s immunization team at national and regional level in this area, especially targeting the regions with low coverage.

Background and Project Description
The Spotlight Initiative is a global partnership between the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in support of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. It was launched in September 2017 by the UN Secretary-General and the EU High Representative and Vice President (HRVP). This Initiative provides a model for partnerships with donors, civil society, and the UN to deliver on the SDGs in a comprehensive manner leveraging comparative expertise. SDG 5 and the achievement of gender equality are placed at the centre of efforts (alongside Goal 16) with the aim to provide an enabling environment for the implementation of all goals. Within the UN, the Initiative will operationalize the UN development system reforms and model a new way of delivering on the SDGs in an integrated way, leveraging collaborative advantages.
In Guyana, the Spotlight Initiative aims to address the root causes of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) with an emphasis on the prevention of family violence which includes sexual and gender-based violence, intimate partner violence and school-based violence.  Therefore, under the pillar related to “institutional strengthening”, it is recognised that longer-term plans of action (and “visioning”) are needed for documented sector plans which are actionable and monitored. These actions will help address, among other things, the power imbalance and gender equality as a foundation for the work on Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG), siloed approaches, and matters of accountability within and between sectors. It will provide institutions with key tools to allow for increased “decentralized” responses in the sectors and in the local governance system to strengthen access to prevention and response services (including access to justice and social support). 
The products of this consultancy will become a critical reference point(s) for the work related to the gender-responsive budgeting into government programmes and mechanisms for the systematic analysis of the impact of policies on EVAWG. It is also expected that the products of this consultancy will assist in ensuring task forces and reporting mechanisms are strengthened to support the coordination, monitoring, accountability and oversight of work on family violence.
