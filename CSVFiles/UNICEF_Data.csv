UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child,  a chance in life! 
The Constitution of January 18, 1996 made the Republic of Cameroon a decentralized unitary state, provides the framework for regions and communes as the two types of decentralized local authorities or collectivites territoriales decentralisees (CTD). These territorial authorities are mandated by the law pursuant to Article 26 (2) of the Constitution. It is within this framework that the law n°2019/024 of December 24, 2019 on the General Code of Decentralized Territorial Collectivities, which aims to bring together, in a single document, the main legal provisions that intervene in the organizational arrangement and functioning of the CTDs.Perceived by the public authorities as the fundamental axis for the promotion of development, democracy and good governance at the local level, the decentralization process is everyone's business and oversight responsibility fall under the involvement of the State, the CTDs, citizens and all actors in life. The Ministry of Decentralization and Local Development is the main public government body that has been mandated to support the implementation of the decentralization policy and is the main authority for the CTDs to ensure they meet their objectives for the decentralization process. Such a process will require ensuring CTDs are equipped with knowledge and resources to translate into action the 2019 Code of Decentralization. To realize this objective, digitalization of the Code is critical to reach the wide array of audience such as programmers, policymakers, planners and community representatives, to name a few, where they can extract the legal terms into practical actionable solutions.Digitalization of the CODE will include the use of New Information and Communication Technologies (NICTs) to convey the messages of the legal instrument effectively and in a user-friendly approach. Timing to digitalize the code is appropriate in Cameroon's current internet penetration rate is around 30 to 35 % of households and it continues to grow. In addition, out of the 360 municipalities in Cameroon, 210 municipalities are already connected to CAMTEL's optical fibre, and the State is continuing to invest in order to reach the 100% coverage rate of municipalities.These figures are indicators showing the potential of NICTs for the popularization of texts on decentralization. NICTs constitute an effective basis for generalized access to the legal framework of decentralization. The digitalization of the Code of CTDs will also seek to reach children as one of the important audience members to promote meaningful and sustainable participation of children as part of the decentralization process. In addition, the digitalization of the CODE will indicate how children's needs and well-being can be achieved as communes and regions move towards implementing the Plans Communaux de Developpemente (PCD) and regional level plans. 
Below are the anticipated phases on the digitalization of the code lead by MINDDEVEL:
Phase 1: Translate the Code legal language into sectoral groups to develop user friendly content including a guide for children to promote meaningful participation but also inform actors on the role of the CODE to promote safe and child friendly cities.
Phase 2: Develop and identify the digital platform (i.e website, mobile application) to upload the user-friendly content.
Phase 3: Integrate the use of the digitalized Code into existing and/or new policy dialogues, programme development processes as well as enhanced efficient and effective delivery of public services for the respective targeted population groups.
How can you make a difference?
Under the guidance of the Chief of Social Policy, UNICEF Cameroon and the focal point government partner of MINDDEVEL, the consultant will be responsible for the following tasks and results:
Development of an inception report: 

Review and list good products developed on decentralization guides from other regions, in particular West and Central African regions, that promote child friendly approaches including child participation.

Conduct a desk review of existing resources in Cameroon to inform the development  of the guide for children and user-friendly content from the CODE based on the identified sectoral categories agreed upon by the technical working group chaired by MINDDEVEL.
Outline the proposed methodology and approach to the development of the guide for children.
Proposed an annotated table of content for the guide for children to be presented and consulted with not only central level partners but selected representatives from the CTDs and adolescents and youths. 

Development of user-friendly content for the CODE based on the sectoral groups to promote safe and child friendly neighborhoods/quartiers/communes: 

In close coordination with the selected national consultant in Cameroon, provide on-line advice and technical inputs on the message around the sectoral categories/headings of the CODE.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

For every child, 

Since 2015, Greece has seen over 1,200,000 migrants arriving on its territory both through its land and sea borders, including migrants in a situation of vulnerability such as Unaccompanied Migrant Children (UMC). Given that legal pathways facilitating mobility out of the country are either extremely limited (e.g. bilateral relocation schemes) or are realized only after the completion of lengthy procedures (i.e. family reunion under the Dublin Regulation) and whereas arrivals continue on a stable basis, the already overstretched national reception system has been struggling to respond to the needs of over 120,000 refugees and migrants in Greece, either living under inappropriate conditions or remaining in limbo in regard to their future.
UNICEF became operational in Greece in early 2016 as an outposted team from the Regional Office of Europe and Central Asia (ECARO) to respond to the significant influx of refugee and migrant children and their families at that time. The response centered on a two-track approach covering direct service delivery as well as national capacity building through critical partnerships with governmental bodies, ministries, local authorities, civil society and NGOs and focused primarily on three main strategic sectors – child protection, education and child rights monitoring.
Following several years of engagement with national stakeholders, UNICEF and the Government of Greece made a decision in January 2020 to formalize the agency’s presence in the country under the form of a Greece Country Office. This office falls under the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia located in Geneva, which supports the work of 21 Country Offices within its geographical scope, reporting in turn to global headquarters in New York.
Since September 2020, UNICEF has expanded its programme in Lesvos responding to the emergency needs of refugee and migrant children and their families. Specifically, UNICEF is leading the WASH sector response for the new RIC site in Lesvos and coordinating efforts to ensure access to services (education, GBV prevention/response and child protection).

BACKGROUND
On 9 September 2020, several fires broke out at the Moria Reception and Identification Center (RIC) located on the Greek island of Lesvos. The center, home to approximately 12,000 refugees, migrants and asylum seekers (out of which 4,200 are children) was severely damaged forcing people to flee for safety. To address the immediate needs of displaced migrants, a new temporary site has been established in the vicinity of Kara Tepe. Currently 6,916 migrants (out of which 2,413 are children) are registered and sheltered in approximately 614 tents and 8 Rubb halls tents. Various humanitarian actors immediately engaged in setting up emergency WASH infrastructure and provision of WASH services at the new site.
 
UNICEF and WASH in RIC Mauravouni
From September 2020, the Red Cross started with cold-water, grey water and since December, hot water trucking, distributed through 8 (plus 1 COIVD) tap stand location., hot water trucked and distributed to 5 hot shower facilities and grey water desludged from the RIC to the municipal wastewater treatment plant. On an average around 160 m3 cold water trucked daily to RIC. For shower facilities, around 60 m3 hot water trucked to RIC which ensures hot water for around 1000 hot showers/day, with around 200m3 desludging of grey water. With the departure of the Red Cross, from April 2021, UNICEF will take over all water trucking responsibilities the creation of a new water distribution network is planned to be completed by end of June 2021.
Due to urgent needs and the specific nature of the land (archaeological site), portable chemical toilets have been deemed the most appropriate for the first stage of the response. Toilets are clustered in several locations. Various WASH actors have already provided and installed 424 chemical toilets (ratio 17 people per toilet when all operational). From April to until June 2021, UNICEF will take likely take over management of half of temporary toilet services and all of the temporary shower facilities to provide a continuation in services, bridging the gap between emergency to sustainable solution (Container based toilet and Shower facilities connected with centralized sewerage network).
The Lesvos RIC is now in a transition phase from emergency to more durable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) solutions. UNICEF, supported by the EU’s DG HOME, is responsible to install a new sewerage system, working alongside the government who will install the water system. Connected to these systems will be toilet and shower containers in sufficient numbers to meet EASO standards and indicators. UNICEF is also co-chair of the WASH sector in RIC, Lesvos. Solid waste is collected daily and other forms of waste, primarily plastic bottles are collected by a team of cleaners engaged by the local authorities and various NGOs. There is a waste work subgroup to ensure coordination camp waste management activities and to report back to WASH sector.
 
Hygiene promotion is ongoing and is done by the international and local NGOs. However, there is a hygiene sub-group who are coordinating hygiene practices, hand washing, safe storage of drinking water and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. UNICEF has a partnership agreement with IRC to support hygiene activities in camp.
UNICEF also plays an active role in the site operations coordination, which works with RIC management, Ministry of Migration and Asylum Technical Services another key site organisations in supporting the effective implementation of improvement works.
 
Other UNICEF Programmes
As well as WASH activities in RIC Lesvos, UNICEF is implementing through its Partners an integrated programming on child protection, non-formal education, female friendly spaces and pGBV inside and outside the temporary RIC, aiming at ensuring key services for all children on the island, in close coordination with UNHCR and other relevant actors. Since January 2021, UNICEF is chairing the Education Sub-Working Group in Lesvos. Furthermore, UNICEF is currently on assessment phase for further expanding its support in Samos and potentially providing similar programmes in all first reception Aegean islands.
 
PURPOSE
The strategy of the WASH sector in the present RIC will focus on supporting the Government of Greece to establish, operate and maintain adequate WASH facilities, transitioning from emergency to permanent infrastructures, as well as providing an access to safe water, sanitation and solid waste management services, including promotion of proper hygiene behaviors and COVID-related Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures.

For Every Child, AN ADVOCATE:
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, nutrition, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

Taking full advantage of the opportunity presented to rebuild better conditions for hand hygiene in the context of COVID-19, UNICEF and WHO have initiated consultations on Hand Hygiene for All Initiative (HH4A). This WHO and UNICEF-led initiative calls for countries to lay out comprehensive roadmaps that bridge together national COVID-19 preparedness and response plans with mid- and long-term national development plans to ensure hand hygiene is a mainstay beyond the pandemic, as part of infection prevention and control (IPC) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) efforts. The initiative is calling on several platforms such as the WASH Cluster, Sanitation and Water for All, the World Economic Forum to prioritize hand hygiene but more importantly, take a whole of society and systems approach to hand hygiene. The initiative also aims to support countries and development partners to develop a coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak, to ensure that hand hygiene is adequately included in coronavirus responses.
The Hand Hygiene for All initiative was launch at the end of June 2020 for which a number of advocacy materials have been prepared. Going forward, the HH4A Initiative will focus on the development of plans, develop and implement tools and workstreams and materials to translate the initiative into action at global, regional and country level. Mirroring the coordination mechanism at global level, the HH4A Initiative will establish regional coordination mechanisms tasked to coordinate between core partners at regional level; engage regional stakeholders and stakeholder platforms; support countries to develop roadmaps, monitoring and knowledge exchange; and capture innovations and distill lessons learnt at regional level.
This consultancy will help to set up and maintain a functional coordination and advocacy mechanism at regional level as well as strengthen the regional office’s capacity to provide technical support to country offices for the Hand Hygiene Initiative.

How can you make a difference?
Background:
The UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA), through effective support to country offices (COs) and strategic engagement with partners, contributes to winning support for the cause of children from decision makers and the wider public particularly on priority issues in South Asia. This includes providing technical assistance, capacity-building and coordination to enhance digital advocacy in the region. UNICEF South Asia works in eight countries and is working to implement UNICEF's Strategic Plan 2018 - 2021 in the region. For more targeted efforts, UNICEF South Asia has translated the Strategic Plan into six headline results (save newborns, stop stunting, every child learns, eradicate polio/fully immunized child, end child marriage, stop open defecation).
Anchored in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF's strategies for change are aimed to yield concrete results for children, charting a course towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 - and the realization of a better world for every child. UNICEF views the private sector as a vital partner in these global efforts.
The business sector plays an important role in the wellbeing of children in their communities in which they operate. Businesses have a strong impact on the lives of the employees, their consumers, their suppliers, and on the communities they serve. From determining the working conditions, health coverage, skills training and employability of workers, to the environmental impact of their operations on the community, businesses have a critical impact on the wellbeing of children and society.
Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Children's Rights and Business Principles (CRBP), businesses have a responsibility to respect child rights. UNICEF engages with the business sector at all levels, including small and medium enterprises, multinational corporations, government institutions, independent regulatory bodies, corporate foundations, industry bodies and multi-stakeholder platforms. Types of partnerships range from financial partnerships to working groups dedicated to improving business policy and practices to respect and support children's rights.
The UNICEF Business for Results (B4R) initiative aims to integrate business sector engagement by mainstreaming the relevance and potential of the business sector across all of the organization's programming. The B4R strategy is drawn from UNICEF's Strategic Plan 2018 - 2021, which identifies leveraging the power of markets and business to maximize progress for children. A central pillar of this capacity building programme is a country-level ‘Deep Dive in Business Learning’ journey for country offices, which consists of preparatory work in collaboration with relevant regional offices (including assessment/analysis, mapping, e-learning), a face-to-face or virtual workshop, action planning and follow-up technical support. The deep dive learning journey builds upon the Programme Guidance Note for Engagement with Business and explores the role of business across five areas: Business as a provider of essential goods and services; Business as an employer; Business impact on communities and environments; Business as a source of innovation, finance and technology; The voice and influence of business.
UNICEF ROSA actively supports the RO and COs to effectively leverage the private sector to accelerate programmatic results. It has set the years 2020 and 2021 to further implement B4R in the region- and to develop strong capacities for understanding and applying the organization’s goals and processes of Private Sector Engagement (PSE). UNICEF ROSA’s action plan for private sector engagement (PSE) includes three interlinked layers:

Support and capacity building for UNICEF in South Asia
Support implementation of regional and country office private sector engagement priorities
Generate regional-level evidence, tools and guidance
Support internal and external advocacy

In 2020, UNICEF ROSA prioritized understanding the needs and challenges of COs and developing their capacity to effectively and holistically engage with the private sector and governments to address the impacts of business. As part of that, UNICEF ROSA executed several B4R Deep Dives to equip COs with the skills to be able to integrate B4R in planning and programming. It also facilitated thematic deep dives. One such deep dive focused on family friendly policies and how business could be engaged to improve the lives of children and families through workplace measures.
UNICEF South Asia is seeking to follow through on the capacity-building groundwork of 2020 and support ongoing efforts to prepare ROSA to strategically and holistically engage the private sector, including on building capacities, engaging business, creating evidence and tools at a regional level, and scaling up existing and successful work. Furthermore, as ROSA is preparing for its new Regional Office Management Plan (ROMP), it is looking to provide guidance to all programme and supporting sections to ensure that private sector engagement is considered in their theory of change, where and when it makes sense.
Purpose:
UNICEF ROSA is looking for an international contractor with background in business engagement and program management to support the development and initial execution of B4R across South Asia.
The primary goal of this assignment is to implement regional and country office level efforts identified for 2021. To this end, the consultancy will:

Coordinate research and dissemination for new reports
Support the development of advocacy assets that take report findings from paper to action
Support the implementation of regional level priorities, specifically around employment and skills, mental health and climate change;
Integrate B4R into Regional Adviser (RA) plans and the next ROMP; and 
Support the development of partnerships.

Main Responsibilities and expected results:
Under the guidance of the Regional Corporate Alliances Specialist, the incumbent will support the Regional Office for South Asia in the following:  

Support the implementation of regional and country level priorities  



Support the development of a plan for the implementation of regional level priorities, specifically on mental health, employment and skills and climate change.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

 210224 Nutrition Supply Chain Specialist - final.pdf
UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, a future
Background
In West and Central Africa Region, and specifically in its Sahelian zone, and protracted emergency countries regularly affected by nutrition crisis, high levels of stunting and wasting are negatively impacting on child survival and development. UNICEF is playing a lead role in the prevention and care of all forms of malnutrition to achieve the 2030 World Health Assembly and SDG goals. Nutrition is a key priority of UNICEF agenda in West and Central Africa, as reflected in the Key Result for Children # 2 (Prevention of stunting). 
Nutrition and Supply teams, both at regional and country level are joining efforts to develop robust nutrition supply chains, as a key component to achieve programmatic goals. 
To respond to programmatic objectives, UNICEF has developed and strengthened nutrition supply chains over the past decade. With an average of 1.2 million cartons a year, Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) became the most distributed commodity in the region, representing the highest value and volume for a single item, resulting both in financial risks and logistics challenges
In most countries, Nutrition Supply Chain has been established in parallel of national health supply chains. The appropriation by and accountability of national counterparts; as well as the ability to monitor and report are common and significant bottlenecks identified across the region. Additionally, one of the key elements will be to define role and accountabilities of each stakeholder within the supply chain until the last mile beneficiary. 
Country offices are accountable for identifying the supply chain fundamentals and for accompanying capacity development strategy needed for UNICEF supply and program staff to achieve the goals of the country program document, the UNICEF Strategic Plan, and the SDGs. 
From 2019 and 2020, the Regional Office engaged with nutrition stakeholders in the above-mentioned countries to focus on End User Monitoring issues (including setting qualitative and qualitative indicators on supply availability and service delivery; developing data collection tools and rolling out the project). This resulted in 4 case studies documenting the experience.  Additionally, support was provided for establishing an integration road map using the maturity model. ECHO and DFID are directly supporting this initiative.

Comment faire la différence ?
Le principal but de l’enquête est de faire l’analyse situationnelle de l’accès à l’eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement (EHA) dans tous les établissements scolaires du primaire et du secondaire du Gabon permettant ainsi de guider l’élaboration d’une stratégie efficiente d’EHA pour l’accès universel aux services EHA en milieu scolaire. Spécifiquement, il s’agira de :
•            Définir une méthodologie de collecte de données fiable et tenant compte du contexte national à travers l’utilisation des outils digitaux avec implication des parties prenantes du secteur éducation,
•            Collecter toutes les données actualisées requises pour une analyse situationnelle de référence sur les services EHA dans les établissements scolaires et qui serviront à concevoir une base de données à insérer dans l’annuaire des statistiques scolaire du Gabon,
•            Analyser les données de base avec toutes les qualités requises, sur l’EHA à l’école, pour une utilisation optimale et une progression vers les ODD en matière d’’accès universel aux services EHA en milieu scolaire au Gabon.
•            Elaborer un rapport qui servira d’outil de référence pour le plaidoyer et la programmation des interventions EHA en milieu scolaire.
 
En tant que défenseur des droits des enfants, vous aurez les devoirs/tâches suivants :
1-           Contexte et justification
En réponse à la pandémie de la COVID-19, le Gouvernement gabonais a élaboré un plan stratégique axé sur : (a) le réaménagement du calendrier scolaire ; (b) la mise en place au sein des établissements, des mesures garantissant aux personnels enseignants, élèves et leurs parents des conditions sanitaires face aux effets du COVID-19. Au Gabon, la situation de l’accès aux services d’Eau, d’Hygiène et Assainissement (EHA) dans les établissements scolaires n’est pas connue. À date, le ministère de l’éducation ne dispose d’aucune base de données actualisées et d’informations suffisantes en ce qui concerne l’accès aux services d’EHA dans les établissements scolaires. Ce gap d’information constitue une limite pour conduire des actions de plaidoyers en faveur l’EHA en milieu scolaire. Cependant, compte tenu de l’importance cruciale du respect des mesures barrières pour lutter contre la propagation de la COVID 19 dans les établissements scolaires, un inventaire rapide sur l’approvisionnement en eau dans les établissements scolaires fait par le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale a révélé que 84% des établissements secondaires et 61% du primaire disposent d’une source d’eau. Aucune donnée n’est disponible concernant l’accès à l’assainissement (latrines, gestion des déchets, nettoyage), l’hygiène des mains et menstruelle ou la prévention et contrôle des infections.
Dans le cadre de la stratégie COVID 19 du Gouvernement, l’UNICEF appuie le Ministère de l’Education nationale pour la mise en œuvre d’un projet visant à contribuer à la prévention et le contrôle de la Covid-19 en milieu scolaire. Ce projet contribue au retour à l’écoles dans les meilleures conditions sanitaires pour tous les élèves à court terme et à moyen terme de renforcer l’accès aux services l'eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement (EHA) dans les écoles à travers des initiatives de plaidoyer et de financement pluriannuel. Il met l’accent sur les interventions du secteur Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement qui favorisent l’apprentissage dans un milieu assaini, sécurisé et protecteur pour les élèves, les enseignants et le personnel administratif des écoles. Les premières phases du projet ont contribué à l’organisation des examens scolaires et ensuite la rentrée des classes dans les meilleures conditions sanitaires de prévention de la COVID 19 dans les 757 établissements scolaires bénéficiaires du projet.
Le projet met également un accent sur le plaidoyer et la pérennisation des services de l'EHA dans tous les établissements scolaires gabonais.

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

Mali is experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis due to recurrent population displacements caused by conflict and insecurity characterized by the presence of non-state armed groups with an extension of insecurity along the borders in the Liptako Gourma countries (Burkina Faso and Niger), recurrent inter-communal conflicts, increased crimes, presence of improvised explosive devices, violence, particularly in the northern and central regions, attacks against national and international armed forces as well as against humanitarian organizations. The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is steadily increasing, rising from 217,000 in January 2020 to nearly 333,000 as of January 31, 2021. The consequences of climate change (floods and drought) plus the Covid-19 pandemic that emerged in March 2020, have increased the vulnerability of populations and the severity of their needs.
In 2021, the country had 11.7 million people affected, 5.9 million of whom needed humanitarian assistance. Of these affected people, 54% are children. Priority needs are related to Water/Hygiene/Sanitation, education, nutrition, protection of civilians but also health. 403,000 children were affected by the closure of schools in December 2020 mainly due to insecurity.
The Ebola virus disease also represents a significant risk for Mali. The national authorities of the Republic of Guinea declared the Ebola epidemic on February 14, 2021. As of March 4, the country has 13 confirmed cases, 4 probable cases and 8 deaths. As long as the disease prevails in Guinea, Mali will be exposed with regard  to the porous nature of the 800 km long border between Mali and Guinea with many mixing points between men and women from different countries in the sub-region and therefore potential foci for the spread of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).
In February 2020, the Malian Ministry of Public Health developed an Action Plan on the prevention and control of the covid-19 epidemic. The Covid-19 outbreak is creating significant additional pressure on the already overburdened social service delivery systems, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of affected populations. By 5 March 2021, Mali had registered 8,509 coronavirus cases and 358 deaths. UNICEF is positioned on risk communication activities, water and hygiene reinforcement in health facilities, schools and communities, support to health care activities, support to vaccination. Under the Covax initiative, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs in Mali, with the support of UNICEF, WHO and other partners including NGOs, received 396,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 on 5 March 2021.

For every child, a hero 
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
UNICEF North Pacific (NP) office is relatively a new office based in Pohnpei, FSM. It covers three countries in the Pacific region (FSM, RMI and Palau) and is expanding its scale of programme including Education. Thematic focus of the education programme is expected to include early childhood education (ECE), inclusive education and out-of-school children, school-based disaster risk reduction and/or other emerging priorities. In addition, the current situation around COVID-19 as a global pandemic has reinforced the need to intensify education response to promote continuity of learning and physical/social/psychological wellbeing. In line with the growth in Education programme, there is a strong need to have a staff on the ground in Pohnpei to support the programme as part of the UNICEF team, working in close collaboration with government, partners and communities, as needed.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Research
The Office of Research-Innocenti (OoR-Innocenti) is the dedicated research office of UNICEF. It undertakes and commissions research on emerging or current issues of relevance for children in order to inform the strategic directions, policies and programmes of UNICEF, Governments and their partners. The Office explores emerging issues, identifies research gaps, brings together existing researchers, and supports or undertakes research and data collection to address critical questions and to inform policy dialogue and implementation at country level.
Education is a key focus of UNICEF Innocenti, with research on education and learning to support the implementation of best practices for education systems, policies and programmes. Working with UNICEF Headquarters, regional and country offices as well as universities and international partners, the education team supports 50+ countries worldwide in conducting evidence-based reviews and field research.
Activities in the READ (Research on Education And Development) unit are carried out in six main streams:
a) Teacher motivation, attendance and of time on task (‘Time to Teach’ project)‘Time to Teach’, one of READ team’s research projects, focuses on the determinants of teacher motivation, attendance and of time on task in 20 countries across Africa, influencing national policy and building national capacities in mixed-methods research through in-country training. ‘Time to teach’ is so far active in East and Southern Africa, West and Central Africa and Morocco.
b) Positive deviant practices and behaviors at school level (Data Must Speak project)Since 2019, in line with UNICEF Foundational Learning and Numeracy (FLN) Programme, Data Must Speak (DMS) identifies positive deviant schools (i.e. schools that outperform others in terms of learning, equity and retention even though they operate with equivalent resources and contexts). The research explores why those positive deviant schools are outperforming others and investigates how these behaviors/practices could be optimally scaled in lower performing schools. DMS is demand-driven and uses a co-creation and co-implementation mixed-methods approach combining quantitative, qualitative and participatory implementation research as well as behavioral and scaling science, to improve uptake, replicability and sustainability. The research is so far undertaken in ten countries in Asia and Africa.
c) Digital learning (Learning Passport and Akelius projects)The digital learning programme investigates the development, implementation and effectiveness of digital learning across various settings (no/low/high connectivity), modalities of use (blended/remote learning), populations, and education goals. Building mixed methods research into large scale digital learning partnerships such as the UNICEF-Akelius foundation partnership and the Learning Passport provides evidence on how to operationalize Reimagine Educations goal of delivering world class digital learning solutions to marginalized children. Currently research is being undertaken with digital learning in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Greece, Lebanon, Mauritania, Serbia and Timor Leste. d) Girls’ and marginalized children’s education (Let Us Learn (LUL) project)The LUL project investigates how innovations in education delivery can increase opportunities to access and improve learning for the most marginalized children with a specific focus on girls. LUL programme and mixed methods research is undertaken in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Liberia, Madagascar and Nepal.
e) Early Childhood Education (including in reference to COVID-19)The early years of a child’s life are critical to building the foundations of learning that help them succeed in school and beyond. READ is establishing a new research portfolio focused on early childhood education. Priority activities for this year include an evidence review of what works, how and in what context, in improving equitable access to and learning quality in pre-primary education. The team is also developing and trialing resources to support parents and caregivers of children with disabilities during remote learning.
f) Sport for Development (S4D project)In countries around the world, sport, recreation and play are improving the health and well-being of children and youth. Sport for development (S4D) organizations harness the power of sport as an inclusive mean of helping children to improve their health; to develop their social, educational and leadership skills; to empower them; and of course, to play and have fun. S4D protects children’s right to play while contributing towards the Social Development Goals. Our research, in partnership with the Barca Foundation investigates the best practices that Sport for Development (S4D) organizations could follow to ensure optimal child outcomes in terms of education, health, empowerment, protection and life skills.

1.       Background and ContextThe COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. It is also a human, economic and social crisis. Countries around the world are being challenged by increasing demand for health care of people with COVID-19, compounded by fear, stigma, misinformation and limitations on movement that disrupt the delivery of essential services. In Montenegro, as of 3 March, there were a total of 8,775 active cases of COVID-19 – with a 14-day cumulative incidence of 1,097 cases per 100,000 persons. The total number of registered cases since March has been 77,493, which means that more than twelve percent of Montenegrins have been, as per official records, infected with the coronavirus. The total number of fatalities associated with COVID-19 was 1,031, which is 1,641 per million inhabitants. There is a noticeable issue of non-adherence by the population to recommendations on social distancing, mask wearing, handwashing and other precautionary measures. Potential causes for this are public fatigue with the prolonged public health crisis, a lack of trust in public institutions and limited effectiveness of containment measures. Fatigue about risk communication and community engagement  messaging and loss of trust in public institutions may also drive  negative attitudes vis-à-vis the new COVID-19 vaccine that could hinder vaccine uptake. Another challenge is that the COVID-19 outbreak and response has been accompanied by an “infodemic”: an overabundance of information from various sources — some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to decide which is a trustworthy source of information. The fight against disinformation is a joint effort involving all stakeholders encouraging them to promote authoritative sources of information, as well as demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading.
Immunizations are an essential health service that protect susceptible individuals from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD). Preventing a VPD outbreak not only saves lives but requires fewer resources than responding to the outbreak and helps reduce burden on a health system already strained by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Montenegro, in addition to the COVID-19 crisis, is faced with critically low, declining immunization rates. Immunization coverage rates for first dose of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR1) have been decreasing in recent years – from 90% in 2010 to 42.1% in 2018 (the year of the latest public report), which is a critically low rate[1] and one of the lowest in Europe and Central Asia region. This means that almost 60% of all young children were not protected from the most contagious vaccine-preventable diseases. Some municipalities are especially at risk, for example Budva where MMR1 coverage was only 15% in 2018. In addition, every seventh child in Montenegro was not protected from Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis 3 (DTP3) in 2018. In early 2020, Montenegro, with the support of the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asian conducted a Root Cause Analysis of suboptimal immunization coverage at the sub-national level. Some of the main root causes were: insufficient knowledge of paediatricians in contraindications and in interpersonal communication (IPC) for immunization, lack of motivation of immunization service providers for timely immunization and weak accountability of service providers for achieving immunization targets, strong anti-vaccination campaign in media and social networks and weak nation-wide mechanisms for generating demand for immunization[2].
Already declining immunization rates are, at the global level, further adversely affected by COVID-19. In Montenegro, according to media reports, immunization coverage rates decreased further during 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to below 20% for MMR1 at national level and approximately 10% in the capital, Podgorica. Urgent actions are required to ensure that the low immunization rates do not plummet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 situation also represents an important opportunity for health systems strengthening, for example by identifying, understanding and modifying immunization policy and practice issues that contribute to missed opportunities for vaccination, or by addressing issues in the supply chain or by strengthening collaborations with other sectors to engage or reach underserved populations.
In order to respond to the above challenges, in December 2020, UNICEF Country Office in Montenegro and the EU Delegation to Montenegro signed a two-year Action “Strengthening health system resilience and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and epidemiological risks”. The overall objective of the Action is to ensure that inhabitants of Montenegro, particularly children and vulnerable  groups, benefit from improved protection from the COVID-19 epidemic as well from vaccine preventable diseases, while the Action specifically aims to ensure that inhabitants of  Montenegro, particularly children and vulnerable groups, benefit from a strengthened public health system through improved risk communication and community engagement on COVID-19 and improved immunisation services.
This Action consists of two components. Component One aims at strengthening health system for adequate risk communication and community engagement response to COVID-19 in order to ensure that citizens and professionals adhere to the preventive measures introduced by the Government. Furthermore, planned activities will also help strengthen national risk communication and community engagement responses for potential future crises. Component Two aims at strengthening the health system to prevent the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, by ensuring continuity of immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath and maintaining trust in immunization. 
2.       Purpose and ObjectiveThe purpose of the assignment is to provide technical expertise and assistance to the implementation of the Action “Strengthening health system resilience and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and epidemiological risks”. The specific objectives of this assignment are:

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

For every child, Development
Background and Justification 
South Africa is a major destination for children on the move from countries throughout Eastern and Southern Africa.  South Africa is a country of contrast, with wide socio-economic inequalities between children and communities. Despite some of the strongest economic opportunities in Southern Africa, South Africa still faces high levels of crime and violence and large populations living in informal settlements without access to basic infrastructure or services.
The Department of Social Development has set up a national taskforce on unaccompanied and separated children. The latter oversees and guides the implementation of an interdepartmental plan of action to address some of the above gaps. In partnership with service providers throughout the country, joint commitment has been demonstrated to finding solutions to the complex problems faced by these extremely vulnerable children.  Yet the reality for many children on the move in South Africa remains that their life continues to be a struggle for survival in the margins of society with an uncertain future – and as such, urgent action is further needed. 
Global Promotion of Best Practices for Children in Migration” supported by  DSD, European Union (EU) and UNICEF 
This global project will be implemented in four countries: Mexico, El Salvador, Zambia and South Africa. The duration of the project is thirty (30) months, starting from 20th October, 2020, and ending on 20th April, 2023. The overall objective of the project in these four countries is: that children on the move are effectively protected and their rights are being realized.
In South Africa, the National Department of Social Development with support from it’s Provincial offices,  is the lead agency to implement the project with support from EU and UNICEF. In support of the implementation of the project, DSD will work with some civil society organizations to complement some of the activities under the project in provinces linking with other government services for children on the move in South Africa.
The project will directly affect and engage with 1) duty bearers at a regional, national, provincial, district and community level and media; 2) public frontline officers and staff (police, civic and immigration officers, social workers, etc.), 3) providers of services (such as civil society organizations, and alternative care providers) 4) key stakeholders such as other UN Organizations, like IOM/UNHCR and other international organizations. The direct target group include the rights holders themselves (i.e. children and adolescents who are on the move or in mixed migration).
The project will mainly provide for activities such as technical assistance to national authorities to develop a multi-sectoral standard operating procedures (SOP) for integrated services, to issue directives and to implement the case management system (including developing cross border case management mechanisms) for children on the move. The activities also include support to DSD’s response to children on the move through the national Steering Committee on Unacompanied and Separated Migrant Children (UASM), supporting UNHCR’s led Best Interest Determination (BID) procedures and capacity building to public officers and frontline workers (social service professionals, police, border officials, immigration officers); support to improve mental health referral pathways; expansion of community-based psychosocial support; strengthening family and community-based care options for children on the move increase access to services such as birth registration, training of social service professionals on how to work with children on the move.
This consultancy will focus on project management to strengthen the capacity at DSD to guide, oversee, manage and steer the implementation of the project, organize advisory board and other meetings, tracking progress, liaison between DSD and UNICEF, liaison with civil society and other partners at all levels.

Sudan, surrounded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya and South Sudan, positioned next to East, West, South and North Africa, is surrounded by complex conflicts in an unpredictable, volatile and rapidly evolving region. Sudan is by size the third biggest country in Africa, with a diverse population of around 42 million people. Sudan's children make up half of the total population, and the past two decades have seen their lives significantly improve: fewer girls and boys are dying before their fifth birthday, primary school attendance is increasing, immunization coverage is high and the country remains polio free. Still, millions of children continue to suffer from protracted conflict in Darfur, the Kordofan's, and Blue Nile, from seasonal natural disasters, malnutrition and disease outbreaks, and from under-investment in basic social services. More than three million of Sudan's school aged children are not in the classroom. UNICEF has been in Sudan since 1952 and continues with a presence in 12 of Sudan's 18 states.

The Global WASH Cluster (GWC) was formed in 2006, building upon the success of an existing Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) humanitarian sector working group. As part of the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Cluster System, the GWC has the primary mandate of “strengthening system-wide preparedness and coordination of technical capacity to respond predictably to humanitarian emergencies and provide clear leadership and accountability in the main areas of humanitarian response”. The GWC supports the 6+1 core functions, which guide cluster coordination at country level to support National Humanitarian WASH Coordination Platforms (NHWCPs), as outlined in the IASC Cluster Coordination Reference Module.[1]
The GWC is led by UNICEF, as the Cluster Lead Agency (CLA), and is a partnership of 80 organizations, 47 full members and 30 associate members, working in the humanitarian WASH sector across international organizations, United Nations agencies, international non-governmental organizations, academic institutes and donors. UNICEF and the GWC partners have designated the Cluster Advocacy and Support Team (CAST) to manage GWC in close collaboration with the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG). The GWC also consists of a Field Support Team (FST), that provides deployable and remote support to national coordination platforms, and Technical Working Groups (TWiGs), that provide technical leadership in key thematic areas, such as Hygiene Promotion, Fecal Sludge Management, Cash and Markets, Quality Assurance and Accountability and Operational Research.
The GWC’s vision is that increased coordination and response quality and capacity of national WASH coordination platforms will result in the improved relevance, quality, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of WASH assistance provided to people affected by humanitarian crises. The GWC is committed to (1) supporting agencies providing appropriate WASH services to those affected by humanitarian crises, (2) ensuring the quality and coherence of the assistance, and (3) ensuring that the assistance is provided in a manner that is equitable, culturally acceptable and protects the dignity of the populations affected by crises.

At global level, the aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and response planning and technical capacity to respond timely to humanitarian emergencies by ensuring that there is predictable and consistent leadership and accountability in the WASH sector.
At country level the aim is to strengthen humanitarian response by demanding high standards of predictability, accountability and partnership. It is about achieving more strategic responses and improved prioritization of available resources through better defining roles and responsibilities of humanitarian organizations and providing the Humanitarian Coordinator with both a first point of call and a provider of last resort in each sector or area of activity.      

The GWC is governed by a Way of Working, which guided the 2016 - 2020 GWC Strategic Plan (GWCSP) in a transparent and efficient manner.[2] The Strategic Plan was composed of five pillars aimed to improve the predictability, timeliness and effectiveness of WASH responses to humanitarian crises, including:

Effective coordination and capacity of the GWC;
Timely operational support to national WASH coordination platforms response as needed;
Improved emergency preparedness of WASH stakeholders
Accountability and learning to facilitates effective WASH cluster actions; and
Operational advocacy for WASH as an essential part of humanitarian response and communication in both emergency and development fora.

The next GWCSP will be developed in 2021 and will take into consideration the achievements and learning from the 2016 – 2020 GWCSP. In addition, it will focus on the important developments in the operating context that have taken place since the last major reforms were introduced under the Transformative Agenda in 2012 and more recently, the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, putting into question where and how the current humanitarian architecture operates and the role and ‘fit-for-purpose’ of the cluster system. It will also draw upon and align to other relevant strategic documents, including the WASH sector’s Road Map 2020 – 2025 and UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2022 – 2025. It will build upon recommendations from relevant evaluations and reviews of UNICEF as a CLA and cluster coordination, including the Humanitarian Review, MOPAN, CLARE II, Realtime Assessment on Coordination, WASH Gap Analysis.
How can you make a difference?
The purpose is to provide an evaluation of the previous GWCSP 2016 – 2020, to inform the next GWCSP 2022 – 2025. The scope of work consists of three main aspects:

Evaluation and review of the GWCSP 2016-2020: This will include a comprehensive and consultative review on the achievements of strategic plan. The review will assess the appropriateness and effectiveness in improving the capacity of NHWCPs to respond to humanitarian emergencies based on the 6+1 core functions. The review will identify bottlenecks, challenges and opportunities within the framework to achieve the outcomes in the GWCSP and put forward key findings and recommendations for the GWCSP 2022 - 2025.
The ‘Way of Working’ of the GWC: This will include a comprehensive revision of the current ‘Ways of Working’ exploring the GWC members’ understanding of the GWC’s role and scope of work; the structure of the GWC (including criteria, membership categories and types); engagement, responsibilities and accountabilities of members; and the functions, roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of the current GWC entities including the CAST, SAG and TWiGs. The review will identify gaps and put forward recommendations to inform the revised ‘Way of Working’ for the GWC.
Development of the GWCSP 2022-2025: This will have a basis in the learning from the review the GWCSP 2016 – 2020, and other key strategic documents, such as the WASH Sector’s Road Map 2020 – 2025 and UNICEF ‘s Strategic Plan 2022 - 2025. The development will include detailed consultations with the GWC’s CAST, SAG, TWiGs and members on how the cluster system will meet the challenges and also identify opportunities for enhanced strategic leadership, improved capacity and resources to deliver a quality WASH response. The strategy will also consider UNICEF’s role as a CLA, as underlined in the Core Commitments of Children (CCC), a core UNICEF policy and framework for humanitarian action and identify  opportunities to strengthen UNICEF corporate commitments to coordination in the WASH sector.[3] Furthermore, the strategy will identify the linkages with the vision and purpose the Global Cluster Coordination Unit (GCCU) at EMOPS UNICEF and more broadly with the Global Coordinator Cluster Group (GCCG) led by OCHA.

In addition, it is expected that for learning purposes, that the review will provide insight to:

Cost-effectiveness: cost-effectiveness of the cluster has been part of the critical elements identified by the donor communities, when analyzing the cost of the cluster approach. A better understanding of the ‘value for money’ of the cluster system is key to harnessing investments that are required to sustain the coordination model.
‘Fit-for-purpose’: sustainability of the humanitarian architecture has also become increasingly important in terms of transition and/or re-structuring of the cluster approach to other models of coordination, such as Area-Based Coordination. A reflection on the ‘fit-for-purpose’ of the cluster system, how it can adapt, evolve and further improve while retaining fundamental functions and principles that have proved essential for effective humanitarian responses is essential.
Accountability: accountability is important, given the substantial resources allocated to the coordination of the WASH responses and the nature of partnership between the GWC members to share common resources appropriately and efficiently.  In addition, how accountability within and between GWC agencies has been enhanced and facilitated by the documentation of lessons learned and best practice is key. The accountability to the affected population, looking at feedback, communications and adapting coordination and response accordingly should also be considered.

Methodology: 
The final methodology to be chosen will be proposed by and agreed upon with the consultant(s) based on a respective technical and financial proposal. It is expected that the selected methodology will be framed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development / Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) evaluation criteria of relevance/appropriateness, connectedness, coherence, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness as well as issues around impact and sustainability.
The methodology should include both summative and formative dimensions. The summative element will review plans and performance to date, to provide impartial evidence on how the coordination and capacity of the GWC have been efficient to achieve the previous strategic plan. The formative and forward-looking element is intended to incorporate learning to improve and develop the next strategic plan and structure of the GWC in the coming years. Note that as an extensive number of reviews and analyses have been completed and/or are under way, the selected methodology should be designed in a way that this review draws upon these as references to avoid duplication of effort.
1. Briefing: the consultant(s) will have briefings with GWC’s CAST, SAG, FST consortium, TWiGs and members.
2. Desk Review: the consultant (s) will be expected to review all relevant cluster documentation, including recent evaluations and reviews such as the Humanitarian Review, MOPAN, CLARE II, Realtime Assessment on Coordination, WASH Gaps Analysis etc.
3. Key Informant Interviews: the consultant(s) will have to undertake interviews with the GWC’s CAST, SAG, FST consortium, TWiGs and members, key members from the Inter-Agency WASH Group, Road Map Steering Committee and NHWCPs. It is estimated that 25 – 30 interviews will be conducted.
4. Stakeholder Survey: an online survey will be shared with all GWC members and the members of NHWCPs. Other key stakeholders identified from inter-cluster/inter-sectoral collaboration will be requested to complete another online survey to ensure consultation beyond the WASH sector.
5. Workshop: given the Covid-19 travel restrictions, a series of online webinars will be conducted to present initial findings and provide an opportunity to brainstorm with key stakeholders. Once the review is finalized, a wrap up webinar will be hosted to present the final recommendations and future “vision” of the GWC and its strategic plan for 2022 – 2025.
Deliverables and Timeframe
The consultant(s) will produce the following outputs, that will be reviewed by the GWC’s CAST and SAG for approval prior to finalization and dissemination. These include:

Inception Report: that clearly presents the methodology for the desk review and data collection and analysis (including draft tools and list of key informants) and timeline for completion of key deliverables, of no more than 5,000 words (plus Annexes).

1. Contexte :
2020 a été marquée par la crise sans précédent causée par la COVID-19. La survenue de la pandémie a bouleversé tous les
comportements humains mais surtout a entrainé une psychose collective et a désorganisé toutes les structures
organisationnelles notamment la gestion des regroupements, des déplacements et de toutes les activités sociales. Les seules
mesures qui ont montré leur efficacité de protection étaient la distanciation sociale, les mesures de protection et d’hygiène,
d’utilisation de gel hydroalcoolique, de lavage de main au savon, de port masque de protection .
En Mauritanie, après les premiers cas autochtones du COVID- 19 le gouvernement a fermé toutes les frontières, limité tout
déplacement non urgent, fermé les transports interurbain et institué des couvre-feux et un confinement strict pour
l’agglomération de Nouakchott.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, fair chance
How can you make a difference?
Background and justification 
The Kingdom of Eswatini is a landlocked country in Southern Africa with a population of 1.133 million. The under-five population is estimated at 150,643 (13.3%) of the total population. The country has four administrative regions; Hhohho, Manzini, Lubombo and Shiselweni. While Eswatini is classified as a middle-income country, 63 per cent of the population live below the national poverty line. Approximately 70% of the population live in rural areas, with most of them dependent on small scale agriculture.
Eswatini suffers chronic food insecurity, slow growing economy and high unemployment rate. The country also has experienced in the past and current years several emergencies including drought, flooding and COVID-19 pandemic which have result in a number of negative health effects on children, including an increase in severe and acute malnutrition (SAM) and stunting; decreased access to clean and safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and a heightened vulnerability to violence.
Eswatini has made great strides in its fight against HIV, and witnessed reductions in incidence and HIV mortality. Yet adolescents and young people age 15-24 account for about 45% of all new HIV infections in Eswatini. The government has identified this age group as a new centre of the epidemic. Among young people, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) bear the disproportionate risk, and therefore require targeted, tailored and integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) messages and services.
In October 2020, following a proposal by UNICEF Eswatini to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), funding was approved to support a package of multi-sector interventions to respond to the impact of climate shocks on women and children in Eswatini. UNICEF has engaged RISE, a local NGO, to work on three (3) specific outcome areas:

Increased coverage and quality of nutrition services for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition;
Increased safe access to water for drinking, hygiene, domestic and livelihood purposes;
Increased coverage and access to quality GBV and violence against children (VAC) prevention and response services.

In the context of this initiative, a C4D plan needs to be designed and implemented in order to promoted demand for the Nutrition, WASH and Child Protection services offered through the project and to promote behavior change at community level to promote infant and young child feeding practices, hygiene and sanitation and promote pro-social norms to prevent violence. 
In addition, UNICEF is the co-lead with MOH on Risk Communication and Community Engagement activities to support the roll out of C19 vaccines focusing on:

Design a demand plan (includes advocacy, communications, social mobilization, risk and safety comms, community engagement and training) to generate confidence, acceptance and demand for C19 vaccines. Must include a crisis communications preparedness planning
Establish data collection system, including 1) social media listening and rumor management, and 2) assessing behavioral and social data;
Develop key messages and materials for public communication and advocacy, in alignment with demand plan.

UNICEF Eswatini is seeking assistance in the form of an individual consultant to support the design and implementation of the above mentioned C4D interventions.
Objective
The overall objective of this consultancy is to provide technical assistance to Eswatini UNICEF Country Office in planning, implementing and monitoring C4D priority interventions covering multisector thematic areas, including WASH, nutrition protection, demand for COVID vaccines.
Scope of work
Under the supervision of the Communication Specialist and in coordination with the MCAH chief and the LLLPD chief, and in consultation with UNICEF program staff, relevant Government ministries and project implementing partners, the consultant will provide technical and operational support to the program team by designing, implementing, monitoring and/or evaluating a variety of C4D initiatives and activities to promote community engagement and participation, and measurable behavioural and social change/mobilization, requiring the application of technical and theoretical skills and thorough knowledge of organizational goals, rules, regulations, policies and procedures to complete tasks.
The key tasks to be undertaken in carrying out and completing the assignment will include the following:

Support the design and development of C4D multi-sector framework (FCDO)
Support the implementation of C4D activities (FCDO and COVID19)
Support the monitoring of C4D activities and changes
Support the documentation of best practices and capacity building of partners on C4D.

Background/Rationale for the Assignment
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak has infected millions of people across the world and caused significant loss of lives. To protect people from the disease, vaccines against COVID have been developed by several manufacturers in a number of countries. It is expected that there will be only limited number of vaccines produced in the early days, and gradually scaled up. Hence, countries will need to prioritize population who will receive the vaccine in the first round. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, the vaccine should go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly. The decision will ultimately be made by national governments.
There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues. Community trust is key to ensure vaccine uptake and buy-in. To build trust, it is important to understand how communities perceive the disease and what are their main questions, doubts, and fears around vaccines, generally, and towards COVID-19 vaccine, more specifically. Previous experience of pandemics and communities’ risk perception about the disease can also influence vaccine uptake. Lack of trust in service providers, past negative experience of vaccination and poor quality of services including negative attitude of service providers may also affect the decision to accept a new vaccine in certain contexts. Similarly, it will be important to understand the trusted source of vaccine, influencers etc. 
It will be important for countries to have a good advocacy communication and social mobilization (ACSM) plan in line with Government’s decision of prioritization of population. The ACCSM plan will have a strong community engagement component, include social listening and community feedback mechanism and evidence-based communication approaches. Families and communities need to be provided with accurate and up to date information on COVID 19 vaccine, based on evidence generated from social listening and behavior and social data, which will include clarification about eligible population and importance of continuing associated behaviours to prevent infection and transmission-engaging communities throughout the process. Demand generation interventions will need to encourage eligible populations to be vaccinated and at the same time manage public expectations and convey that vaccine will not be sufficient for everyone in the beginning.
The Government of the Republic of South Sudan in collaboration with the regional office and donors including GAVI and World Bank plan to support introduction of COVID 19 vaccines in the Republic of South Sudan prioritizing front line health workers and senior members (old age groups) of the community and other high-risk groups then later community at large.
The Communication for Development section is at the forefront in preparation to the introduction of COVID 19 vaccines hence would like to recruit an international consultant to support the introduction of this new vaccine in South Sudan with focus on special population groups targeted for the phased administration of the vaccine to the targeted groups in South Sudan. Purpose & Expected Results
Demand Generation is a key component of COVID-19 vaccine introduction in which UNICEF has been providing global leadership for preparedness of tools and guidance which will guide countries to develop and implement robust evidenced-based interventions to support the vaccine uptake, build and maintain public trust and manage misinformation and crisis communication for the COVAX (COVID 19) vaccine introduction. UNICEF country offices will have increased responsibility to support the national governments to develop and implement the demand generation strategies. As the assignment requires intensive dedicated work, a strong consultant with solid international experience and expertise in the area of demand generation for immunization will be required to support the planning, roll out and monitoring of the COVAX related introduction at the national and to some extent the sub-national level. This position will work closely with the national consultant who will be brought in to leverage the local knowledge and contexts at various levels of the vaccine roll out. A full-time consultant will be needed to support the quick roll out of COVID 19 vaccine as the already existing UNICEF staff members are dealing with significant workload owing to multiple disease outbreaks. Therefore, C4D team is looking to recruit an international consultant to provide rapid support to MoH and partners on C4D/demand generation for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.
Working under the direct supervision of C4D Specialist, the C4D international consultant will support the ACSM task force/RCCE taskforce to roll out the evidence based ACSM/C4D strategy for COVID 19 vaccine introduction and its implementation (as outlined in NDVP Chapter 9 Vaccination Acceptance and uptake). The ACSM/C4D planning will complement the already ongoing work on COVID 19 RCCE work to ensure seamless coordination of ongoing response to vaccine introduction in the country, and to continue the promotion of behaviours to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 both before and after vaccination, prepare countries to respond rapidly to AEFIs with crisis communication plan, and an national/sub national advocacy plan to mobilise wide spread support for COVID-19 vaccination
Some key tasks for this assignment will be:
• Lead the roll out and monitoring of the demand generation component of the National Vaccine Deployment Plan in tandem with the South Sudan COVAX working group, Ministry of Health and implementing partners. • To develop/revise a costed demand generation plan, keeping in mind the phased approach with the targeted population groups over the designated time period including oversight to IEC materials and messages• To successfully monitor promote and sustain the desired behaviour based on evidence for specific population groups targeted for the vaccination • To conduct relevant assessments and analysis for key demand-related drivers including risk perception and vaccine hesitancy • To support coordination with national and sub-national stakeholders, including government, implementing partners • To document demand generation interventions and establish a social listening and rumour management platform to inform crisis communication activities.

How can you make a difference?
Background:
The National Development Plan III is implemented by Government of Uganda (2021-2025) and within it integration of services is a key component. In addition, community level health promotion and prevention programs are national priorities for the health sector with the universal health coverage (UHC) goal aligned to Government of Uganda’s (GOU) Vision 2040. By 2025, the GOU and stakeholders at national and subnational level aim to achieve an increased capacity to sustainably provide an integrated package of quality services for pregnant women, including pregnant adolescents and newborns, as well as infants and young children.
A strong community health system is key in delivering high quality and equitable health services, particularly to vulnerable and rural communities. In 2001, recognizing that the majority of disease burden is preventable diseases, Uganda’s Ministry of Health (MoH) prioritized a community-based approach to primary health care through the use of Village Health Teams (VHTs) to deliver basic health services and education.
The community health system in Uganda is strongly interlinked to the overall formal health system. At the national level, formal structures are in place to govern, oversee, and supervise community health work across the country. As Uganda’s health system is decentralized, implementation and management of community health services are conducted at the district and lower (health sub-district, sub-county, parish, and village) levels. Each district has a health department, which has the mandate to plan and implement health services in their respective district. VHTs are defined as the health care system level 1 (HC1), however they are not usually recognized as part of the formal Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Other critical community resource persons also exist, including but not limited to Health Educators, Health Assistants; Community Development Officers; disease-specific community health workers (e.g., HIV linkage facilitators; case managers), private nonprofit health services; and other community groups (e.g., local council leaders, parish chiefs, religious leaders, teachers, traditional birth assistants, para-social workers, mother peer groups, girl guides, boy scouts). Political, technical, and administrative functions each play a critical role in a strong community health system.
A national community engagement strategy (CES) was launched in October 2020 as part of the Government of Uganda’s COVID-19 response. While the VHT has traditionally been a volunteer cadre, the launch of the CES announced one VHT at HC1 will be paid a monthly allowance and provided with important tools in the setting of COVID-19 that is affecting most of Uganda’s communities.
UNICEF — the United Nations Children’s Fund, is a UN agency that aims at supporting every child to realize their potential in life. UNICEF covers over 190 countries and territories across the world. UNICEF is part of Uganda’s UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025, with a strategic priority aimed at human wellbeing and resilience. UNICEF Uganda plays a key role in supporting GOU to strengthen health systems with a focus on community health systems. Community health workers are a core structure of Uganda’s health system, as defined above.
UNICEF is implementing the iCoHS initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. iCoHS aims to strengthen Uganda’s community health system by supporting governance, enabling digital technology and ensuring improved community health information systems and heightened use of community level data to facilitate integrated health service delivery that will yield better maternal and child health outcomes. The iCoHS project supports Uganda’s Community Health Acceleration Roadmap which highlights six chief priorities including a need to strengthen and sustain (time and financial) investment in supervision and motivation of community health cadres to improve community health outcomes. With iCoHS support centered on strengthening community systems, a consultant will support an improved understanding of existing community health worker cadres, their role and related incentive structures.
Purpose of assignment and scope:
The objective of the consultancy is to support the Government of Uganda to consolidate key findings on the roles, function and motivation of community health workers in Uganda in order to better understand, with a goal to improve, frontline of health service delivery at the community level. A recent community engagement strategy, launched during the GOU COVID-19 response was designed to strengthen village task forces to respond to the pandemic.  With political will to support a monthly allowance of the VHT, it is important to recognize the influence of an incentive structure for such frontline workers.
Under the overall supervision and guidance of the Community Health Specialist, the Consultant will support the Child Survival and Development team to ensure commitment to execution of the Community Health Acceleration Roadmap priority to better understand motivation of community health cadres. In doing so, the consultant must:

Once a global framework and associated methodology is developed, and agreed to with UNICEF CSD, then establish this same approach for Uganda with a literature review for Uganda and some regional context as well. Document key findings and implications for policy and programming.
For gaps identified in no. 2, formulate specific questions and methodology for a  qualitative study integrating key informant interviews and focus group discussions. NB: Ensure focus on pandemic limitations and restrictions for gatherings.
Once methodology is accepted by UNICEF, consultant must outline a plan, conduct relevant data collection, complete any required analysis and finalize a report based on all findings. A powerpoint will also be required.
Report must be validated, finalized and disseminated with MOH and key stakeholders from Uganda’s community health fraternity.

For every child,
BackgroundUNICEF Tajikistan country programme has a clear focus on improving quality of education and expanding access to skills building including for the most marginalized, to ensure a successful transition from school to working life.
Working within the framework of Reimagine Education and Generation Unlimited Global Initiatives, UNICEF Tajikistan is focusing on strenghthening the national institutional capacity to actively engage children and youth in building their competencies by providing competency-based education opportunities with interventions designed to support the development of inclusive career guidance complemented by competence-based learning delivered in formal and non-formal education settings in selected Centres, including technology enabled learning. In order to achieving education transformation and empowerment of young people, a holistic programme has been designed to increase national institutional capacity towards providing adolescent boys and girls with relevant competencies and skills (21st century skills) needed for meaningful engagement in school, at home, at the work place, and society at large, further ensuring continuity of learning and skills development opportunities in case of school closure due to COVID-19 and other emergencies. The designed programme adopts a multiple-pathways and blended approach by providing quality and relevant learning opportunities, career guidance, social entrepreneurship, and job coaching both in formal and non-formal education settings.
The proposed action is in line with the EU support to the education sector and the achievement of the main goals of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016-2030, towards ensuring a transformational sustainable growth with greater diversification of the economy through a competency-based quality education at all levels. Based on the defined Theory of Change, the action is expected to support the operationalisation of the National Education Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 adopted by MoES in April 2020. This includes the modernisation of education system through institutional capacity development for digital learning and the provision of equipment of relevant technology at central and district level, in order to address limited connectivity and remoteness of schools (85% rural schools) and to ensure continuity of learning through developed digital/e-learning solutions both in urban areas and remote areas. The main strategic approach builds on global UNICEF Reimagine Education agenda and strategic vision and aims at strengthening national capacity at all levels towards preparedness and resilience to shocks while actively engaging adolescent girls and boys in Tajikistan in building their competencies and increase their employability. 
How can you make a difference?

The consultancy aims to support UNICEF teams and relevant national counterparts in the planning, implementation and monitoring/documentation of results to be achieved by developed programmes, ensuring specific M&E support to the EU funded project â€œImproving skills and competencies of adolescent girls and boys for school to work transition in Tajikistan and national support to continuity of learning within the framework of the National Education Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19.â€ This task will require the development of an M&E structure and harmonization of inputs/outputs falling under different project teams, along with synergy within existing programmes and projects implemented by the Learning and ADAP sections.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT: Key tasks and activities to be implemented by the consultancy are as follows:

Review existing program result structure and M&E approaches of the Learning and ADAP sections in light of UNICEF Global initiative Reimagine Education and Generation Unlimited. The review will focus on exsisting projects ensuring synergy within the results framework of EU funded project â€œImproving skills and competencies of adolescent girls and boys for school to work transition in Tajikistan and national support to continuity of learning within the framework of the National Education Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19.â€
Develop detailed M&E framework including data collection strategies and tools for Learning and ADAP implementing partners, ensuring synergy and linkage between formal and non-formal education interventions as part of the ongoing related programs.
Provide technical advice and capacity building for national teams responsible for data collection including development of relevant tools as required.
Develop two inception reports for outcome 1 and 2 of the EU funded project â€œImproving skills and competencies of adolescent girls and boys for school to work transition in Tajikistan and national support to continuity of learning within the framework of the National Education Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19â€ including drafting of M&E structure and harmonization of inputs from relevant project teams.

For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

For every child, Education
UNICEF’s Office of Research – Innocenti is looking for interns for four months from 1 April to 31 July 2021. The internship is full-time and to be done with the Research on Education and Development (READ) team of the UNICEF Office of Research, with two months remotely (teleworking) at the beginning of the internship and the two remaining months in Florence, Italy (if travel is possible without restrictions) The Office of Research-Innocenti (OoR-Innocenti) is the dedicated research office of UNICEF. It undertakes and commissions research on emerging or current issues of relevance for children in order to inform the strategic directions, policies and programmes of UNICEF, Governments and their partners. The Office explores emerging issues, identifies research gaps, brings together existing researchers, and supports or undertakes research and data collection to address critical questions and to inform policy dialogue and implementation at country level.
Every Child has the right to learn. However, the gap between what education systems is providing in terms of learning achievements, and what children, communities and economies need, is growing. The breadth and depth of this learning crisis provides the greatest global challenge to preparing children and adolescents for life, work and active citizenship. UNICEF vision for education is that ‘every child learns’, articulated in the 2019-2030 Education Strategy across three inter-related goals: (i) equitable access to learning opportunities; (ii) improved learning and skills for all; (iii) improved learning and protection for children in emergencies and transitions. The generation and use of research and robust evidence are key for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Education Strategy and the UNICEF Strategic Plan for 2018-2021 as reflected in the Priorities for research and data in support of UNICEF’s Strategic Plan – Using the power of evidence to drive change for children. Education is a key focus of UNICEF Innocenti, which constitutes a primary source of robust, comparative evidence on education and learning to support solutions for education systems, policies and programmes. Working with UNICEF Headquarters, regional and country offices as well as universities and international partners, the education team supports 50+ countries worldwide in conducting evidence-based reviews and field research through multi-country studies.
‘Time to Teach’, one of READ team’s research projects, focuses on the determinants of teacher motivation, attendance and of time on task in 20 countries across Africa, influencing national policy and building national capacities in mixed-methods research through in-country training. ‘Time to teach’ is so far active in East and Southern Africa, West and Central Africa and Morocco.Since 2019, in line with UNICEF Foundational Learning and Numeracy (FLN) Programme, Data Must Speak (DMS) identifies positive deviant schools (i.e. schools that outperform others in terms of learning, equity and retention even though they operate with equivalent resources and contexts). The research explores why those positive deviant schools are outperforming others and investigates how these behaviors/practices could be optimally scaled in lower performing schools. DMS is demand-driven and uses a co-creation and co-implementation mixed-methods approach combining quantitative, qualitative and participatory implementation research as well as behavioral and scaling science, to improve uptake, replicability and sustainability. The research is being undertaken in nine countries across 2 continents.
READs innovation in education research portfolio aims to understand how innovations both technology and practice related can be leveraged and scaled up to improve outcomes for marginalized children in and out of school. The digital learning programme investigates the development, implementation and effectiveness of digital learning across various settings (no/low/high connectivity), modalities of use (blended/remote learning), populations, and education goals. Building mixed methods research into large scale digital learning partnerships such as the UNICEF-Akelius foundation partnership and the Learning Passport provides evidence on how to operationalize Reimagine Educations goal of delivering world class digital learning solutions to marginalized children. Currently research is being undertaken with digital learning in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Greece, Lebanon, Mauritania, Serbia and Timor Leste. The Let Us Learn (LUL) programme investigates how innovations in education delivery, from early childhood education, through primary and secondary school, through to vocational training can increase opportunities to access and improve learning for the most marginalized children with a specific focus on girls. LUL programme and mixed methods research is undertaken in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Liberia, Madagascar and Nepal.
The early years of a child’s life are critical to building the foundations of learning that help them succeed in school and beyond. READ is establishing a new research portfolio focused on early childhood education. Priority activities for this year include an evidence review of what works, how and in what context, in improving equitable access to and learning quality in pre-primary education. The team is also developing and trialling resources to support parents and caregivers of children with disabilities during remote learning.

Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges.
UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves. 
In particular, UNICEF will work so that:

Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, a connected world
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. Therefore, the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
The ICTD Transition and Transformation project aims to put in place the capabilities required to support UNICEF’s innovative and digital transformation – including the needs of a post-COVID-19 organizational business model. To discharge its mission and support the over 20,000 globally dispersed staff UNICEF operates a hybrid data center infrastructure with the primary data center being a co-location facility in New Jersey, USA and the backup data center located in Manhattan, New York. These 2 facilities are integrated with 5 Cloud-based data centers in the Singapore, South Africa, The Netherlands, France and East USA Azure regions, all interconnected with Azure ExpressRoutes. 
In its continuing commitment to ensuring Operational Efficiency and Effectiveness, Programme Effectiveness and Innovative use of Technology, ICTD has decided to relocate the Digital Core of the Division to Valencia, Spain, leaving a team of Business Relations Managers and Business Analysts to support Business Partners in Headquarters, and create the first Digital Center of Excellence in Nairobi, Kenya. A key component in this undertaking is the migration of its Data Centers from the USA to Spain and Italy.
UNICEF has decided to relocate its primary data center to Valencia, Spain and its backup/disaster recovery facility to Brindisi, Italy to have a fully built facility by 31st August 2022.

Unplanned downtime is not expected to exceed 8 hours during the transition period.  Both the new primary and backup/recovery sites have been identified and contractual arrangements completed. 
Under the general guidance of the Deputy Director, Solution Center and Support (SCS) and direct supervision of the Chief, Platform Service Delivery (PSD), the Data Center Migration Project Manager coordinates, guides, assesses and evaluates technical options, analyzes risks, reports progress and engages various vendors and technical partners associated with the project.

Background
For more than two decades, UNICEF has been working closely with the national government, local representatives and civil society to improve the situation of children in Kazakhstan, ensuring equal access to quality social services, and primarily, healthcare and education.The Government of Kazakhstan and UNICEF are currently implementing another five-year program of cooperation, based upon national priorities and strategies, for 2016-2020. Along with those national priorities and strategies, however, the country has also taken its international obligations, including attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, into account. The establishment of the Ombudsman for Children, moreover, has presented new opportunities for coordinating activities amongst all organizations dealing with childhood issues. Ensuring equal opportunities for children is the most important task for UNICEF, both in Kazakhstan and around the world. Equality means, that all children are able to survive, develop and fully realize their potential in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Kazakhstan ratified in 1994. The social agenda of the Republic of Kazakhstan is focused on the protection of children’s rights, with close attention paid to children from the most vulnerable groups, including children with special mental and physical developmental characteristics.

Under the framework of social protection, UNICEF Jordan aims to strengthen national system to support vulnerable children to access integrated and inclusive social protection services by providing 1) Technological solutions and capacity building activities of national partner (such as the National Aid Fund NAF through the development and maintenance if their MIS ) 2) Child cash transfers to support multidimensionally poor children’s access schools and retain their attendance 3) An integrated package of services aiming to support child development, child wellbeing and human capital through the Makani Program. below is a brief explanation on each of these three pillars:
The National Aid Fund (NAF) is an independent institution, which was established by Law (Number 36) in 1986 to provide protection and care for needy families and improve their standard of living. The NAF cash transfer program is the largest public cash-transfer based social safety net in Jordan. It provides monthly aid services to approximately 93,000 households, constituting 7.5% of the Kingdom's population. The NAF organizational structure operates nationwide with 41 offices across the country and approximately 400 staff members. The NAF services to needy families fall under several programs that targets vulnerable individuals and families who fall under certain categories in regular or temporary basis. Services of NAF include also Physical Rehabilitation, Training and Employment programs.
In May 2018, the government approved a plan to expand and improve NAF by adding about JD 100 million to the current budget to add 85,000 beneficiary households during the period between 2019-2021. This plan aims also to improve targeting, the graduation of NAF beneficiaries, the mechanism for receiving and responding to applications and grievances, and the Management Information System (MIS). UNICEF is supporting NAF in developing and maintaining the MIS system. The system has been developed for its current phase, but would need additions, updates and changes to meet the requirement of the upcoming phases.
in addition  a System Integrator (SI) for the design, development and implementation of the National Unified Registry (NUR) platform has been designed. The main objective of establishing the NUR platform was to provide a secure, reliable and automated mechanism for f data exchange mechanism between government agencies to support better targeting of social safety net programs; while the outreach worker program aimed to develop an efficient outreach mechanism through technology-based interventions.
The first phase of the NUR platform development has been completed with the design and implementation of the data exchange platform. The Government of Jordan has successfully tested the performance of the NUR platform to assess the eligibility of households for the NAF’s Takaful program through verification/validation of administrative data. During the first two rounds of registration, conducted in July and December 2019, the NAF received more than 360 thousand applications.

UNICEF promotes the rights and welfare of all children and adolescents in everything we do. Together with our allies, we work in 190 countries and territories to transform this commitment into practical actions that benefit all children, especially focusing our efforts on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded, worldwide. The UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office is based in in Panama, operating in 36 territories, with 24 country offices. UNICEF works to put the rights and well-being of children at the heart of the social, political, and economic agenda, in line with our equity focus, working across our organization and with our partners in government, civil society and the private sector to support shifts in public policy, fuel social engagement, and increase investment for children. For more information about UNICEF and its work. (www.unicef.org/lac).
Care and protection of children in the context of human mobility is a priority for UNICEF in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), be they separated, unaccompanied1 or travelling with family2. Children represent approximately 20% of all migrants and refugees in LAC, and the majority of the UNICEF offices in Latin America and the Caribbean are programming in this area. The region has two migration pathways were there is particular concern for child migrants: those from Venezuela3 who travel to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and other countries in the region, as well as those in Central America4 who head toward Mexico and the US. For child protection the focus of our work is to promote ‘safe migration’, which protects children from risks such as violence and exploitation, promotes access to shelter support and care, allows for children to have access to justice and identity. While there are some special services for migrants, such as best interest determination procedures, child friendly spaces and one-stop shops, the actions are usually conducted within the host and transit countries specialized child protection structures. In other words, the shelter care may be offered through the country’s alternative care structures, psycho-social support through the regular help lines and counselling centres, and legal aid and identity through the justice and civil registration systems. While there are some special services specific to migrants, it is still within the system. That said, care options for migrant children are few. That system, particularly considering care and justice is under reform. The region continues to have an over reliance on institutional care and detention. Case management structures are developed within countries, but the ability to share information securely respecting confidentiality and privacy is weak.

1. Contexte et justication du projet
 
Après deux décennies de crises qui ont fait plus de 3000 morts et plus d’un demi-million de déplacés internes, et à sept ans de la crise post-électorale de 2011-2012, la Côte d’Ivoire s’inscrit dans une optique de croissance économique forte, doublée d’un processus de consolidation des institutions démocratiques après les élections apaisées de 2015 et l’instauration de la Troisième République. Cette transition réussie a permis, entre autres, la fermeture de la mission des Nations Unies en Côte d’Ivoire (ONUCI) en juillet 2017. Par la suite, pour accompagner la finalisation du processus de transition, le Gouvernement de Côte d’Ivoire, les Nations Unies et les partenaires internationaux, ont développé un Programme d’Appui à la consolidation de la Paix (PACoP) 2017-2019.
 
L’objectif du PACoP est de contribuer à la promotion de la paix et la réconciliation nationale, pour un objectif à long terme visant à développer un Etat en paix, inclusif et légitime pour lutter contre la pauvreté, réduire les inégalités et renforcer les droits humains. Au coeur des défis résiduels mais essentiels de la transition autour desquels le PACoP a été articulé se trouve la cohésion sociale et un accent particulier a été mis depuis le début de sa mise en oeuvre en janvier 2017 sur les dialogues inter-commentaires et socio-sécuritaires.  

 
Ce projet met un accent particulier sur le rôle complémentaire des jeunes, des femmes et des leaders communautaires en tant qu’acteurs clé mais souvent marginalisés dans la résolution des conflits. Il cherche à consolider la cohésion de manière durable, à travers leur inclusion dans des activités citoyennes et d’éducation à la paix ainsi que des incitatives communautaires pilotes et du renforcement des capacités en matière de prévention et de résolution des conflits. Après un an de mise en oeuvre du projet, tenant compte des résultats et expériences acquises sur le terrain, en juin 2018, il avait été décidé en consultation avec PBSO de recadrer le projet autour de 3 aspects à savoir :
 
• Le renforcement de manière explicite des capacités des femmes et filles en prévention et en gestion de conflits dans leur communauté 
• L’appui aux jeunes pour qu’ils disposent de capacités de prévention et de gestion de conflits dans leur communauté à travers du financement des projets pilote ; et
• Le soutien et l’implication des jeunes dans les instances de prise de décision, notamment en matière de prévention et de gestion des conflits.
 
2. Objectif général

Il s’agira d’évaluer les acquis du projet et documenter les changements qui ont eu lieu à la suite des interventions des différentes parties prenantes à la lumière de la théorie de changement prévue.
3. Objectifs spécifiques
Il s’agira plus spécifiquement de :
 
✓ Évaluer si et dans quelle mesure le projet a eu un effet réel en termes de consolidation de la paix (en lien avec les axes et résultats du Programme d’Appui à la Consolidation de Paix) dans les zones d’intervention ciblées de façon directe ou à travers des effets catalytiques, y compris la pertinence de la théorie de changement
✓ Évaluer la pertinence, l’efficacité, l’efficience, la cohérence et l’effet des actions menées par le projet par rapport aux objectifs visés ainsi que les mécanismes en place pour la pérennisation des résultats ;
✓ Evaluer le mécanisme de mise en oeuvre du projet, les conventions avec les partenaires ;
✓ Évaluer le niveau de satisfaction des différents acteurs clés par rapport au projet lui-même et aux résultats atteints ;
✓ Identifier les principaux enseignements à tirer de la mise en oeuvre du projet, ainsi que les bonnes pratiques qui pourront être répliquées ;
✓ Identifier les expériences (facteurs de succès et leçons apprises) sur lesquelles il faudra capitaliser ainsi que les défis résiduels, et analyser la durabilité des initiatives menées pour la consolidation de la paix et le renforcement de la cohésion sociale ;
✓ Déterminer, au vu du marqueur genre 2 attribué, si le projet a effectivement encouragé l’égalité entre les sexes de façon considérable et cohérente, en veillant à ce que les femmes bénéficient du projet et reflétant leurs préoccupations et intérêts ;
✓ Evaluer dans quelle mesure les autorités gouvernementales et locales ainsi que les communautés et les jeunes se sont approprié le projet et sont capables d’assurer la durabilité de ses interventions ;
✓ Apprécier dans quelle mesure les jeunes et de femmes appuyés dans le cadre de ce programme se sont engagés dans des initiatives de réconciliation et de cohésion sociale au sein de leur communauté ;
✓ Apprécier dans quelle mesure les jeunes estime être écoutés par les institutions.
✓ Formuler des recommandations, y compris sur les procédures de planification et mise en oeuvre des projets potentiels futurs qui vont financer ce type d’intervention ;
4. Produit et résultat institutionnel
Le Résultat Stratégique visé par le projet est de contribuer à la réconciliation nationale et à la cohésion sociale à travers l’engagement civique des jeunes, la participation des jeunes et des femmes en tant qu’acteur de paix, de prévention et de gestion des conflits. Un accent particulier sera mis sur l’inclusion des jeunes filles dans les différents axes du programme.
 
Produit 1 : Les femmes disposent de capacités de prévention et de gestion de conflits dans leur communauté
Produit 2 : Les jeunes disposent de capacités de prévention et de gestion de conflits dans leur communauté
Produit 3 : Les jeunes disposent de capacités d’autonomisation socio-économique pour leur participation aux instances de prise de décision notamment en matière de prévention et gestion des conflits
 

5. Champs d’exécution de la consultance
 
Le projet se déroule dans 11 régions du pays : District d’Abidjan, Grands Ponts, Loh Djiboua, Goh, Haut Sassandra, Sud Comoe Gbeke, Agneby Tiassa, Hambol, Guemon-Cavally-Tonkpi, Poro-Tchologo, Bounkani.
 
6. Méthodologie et approche technique de la consultance

 
De façon spécifique cet exercice devra permettre de collecter les données quantitatives et qualitatives en lien avec les résultats escomptés ou non afin d’apprécier la pertinence, la cohérence, l’efficacité, l’efficience, la durabilité du projet ainsi que la prise en compte des Droits Humains et l’égalité des sexes selon les critères d’évaluation de OECD-DAC.
 
La partie quantitative visera à documenter les effets principaux du projet à travers des données chiffrées collectées auprès des bénéficiaires directs et indirects du projet. Cette partie de l’évaluation prendra le cadre de résultats du projet comme base de travail. A cet effet le Consultant proposera un échantillonnage représentatif en fonction des indicateurs, des cibles et des zones du Projet., ainsi qu’un questionnaire ainsi qu’un mode opératoire pour la collecte de données.
 
La partie qualitative complètera la partie quantitative et visera à approfondir l’analyse et corroborer les voies à travers lesquelles l’approche du projet pourrait contribuer à l’engagement civique, la cohésion sociale et la réduction du niveau de conflictualité. Elle servira également à découvrir des explications alternatives des effets/changements éventuelles attribués au projet et difficilement captées par enquête quantitative. Elle permettra de mieux capter les perspectives et aspirations des bénéficiaires directs et indirects. La partie qualitative consisterait à des focus group avec des bénéficiaires ou à des échanges avec des acteurs institutionnels.

Pourtant, les avancés demeurent fragiles face à des défis multidimensionnels, particulièrement à l’Ouest et Sud-Ouest du pays. Ainsi, les facteurs de fragilité qui conditionnent les perspectives de la jeunesse et des femmes ailleurs en Afrique sont amplifiés par des défis particuliers au contexte ivoirien.

For every child, education...
The Sierra Leone Education Innovation Challenge is one of the world’s largest-scale education outcomes funds. We hope you will join us on this exciting journey to make it a reality.
 Delivering quality education is a top government priority and a global priority (SDG4), and to that end, the Government of Sierra Leone intends to use an outcomes fund approach to determine which interventions and financing approaches work best to improve learning outcomes in government schools.
The outcomes fund - Sierra Leone Education Innovation Challenge (SLEIC) - is being established as a partnership between the Government, donors, education providers, and philanthropies/social investors. The main objectives of the program are to:

Improve learning outcomes (literacy and numeracy) and achievement of minimum thresholds in a representative sample of public schools (rural areas focused), aligned with the Ministry agenda, during and outside COVID-19. The program has a specific focus on improving girls' learning, reflected in the pricing of girls' outcomes at a 20% premium to those of boys. Interventions with a strong gender-inclusive focus will be prioritised. It will facilitate the implementation of distance-learning interventions (if required) and set ambitious learning targets to offset the setbacks in learning from school closures.
Build sustainable capacity in schools to deliver equitable learning outcomes during and outside COVID-19, working across Primary 1 and Primary 6 and targeting interventions that will ensure improved learning for a large number of children beyond the life of the program.
Inform which interventions and financing approaches are most effective to improve learning outcomes in education during and outside COVID-19, why, and at what cost, building on the work already underway as part of the EIC.
Develop a feasible set of solutions for scale: transition promising innovations to scale and provide government, funders, and providers with a model for replicating and scaling cost-effective interventions.
Build provider capacity so that a stronger, more outcomes focused pool of non-state providers available to support education delivery.
Increase outcomes-orientation in policy making and outcomes-based financing incorporated in future GoSL programming and international education financing.
Improve coordination of Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education,  education government agencies (procurement, assessment, inspection), and donors towards the achievement of equitable education outcomes.

SLEIC providers will be paid primarily based on results, rather than inputs, with maximum flexibility to respond to the needs of children Providers will focus their interventions on girls’ unique challenges and will be paid 20% extra for girls’ learning. The innovations will respond to the COVID-19 pandemic with distance learning and a focus on protecting girls. They consider the role of teachers and are fit for education delivery both during and outside emergency circumstances.

And we never give up.
For every child, 

The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted us with an unprecedented situation that has affected and will continue to deeply affect children’s lives worldwide, far beyond any health risks. UNICEF has been closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children, noting that disruptions to families, friendships, schooling and the wider community can have negative consequences on children’s well-being, development and protection. On the other hand, measures used to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus can expose children to additional protection risks.
The European Network of Ombudspersons for Children (ENOC) is a membership body made up of 43 independent children’s rights institutions in 34 countries within the Council of Europe, whose main objective is to safeguard and promote children and young people’s fundamental rights. Its mission is therefore to closely monitor the situation of all children throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as responses from local, national and European authorities during and after the end of isolation measures; to share critical information, good practices and experiences in order to keep children and their families safe; and to guarantee respect of children’s rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant European and International Human Rights instruments.
In this context, ENOC and UNICEF have initiated a collaboration around the issue of COVID-19 and children’s rights, since May 2020 through the launch of a short online survey on Ombudspersons and Commissioners for Children’s responses to the new challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by an online discussion in June on the impact of COVID-19 on the work of over 60 Ombudspersons for Children’s Offices and on children’s rights in their respective countries.
Following up on this ongoing collaboration, UNICEF ECARO has decided to further support ENOC to provide direct technical assistance to a number of Ombudspersons for Children’s offices in Europe and Central Asia for the undertaking and completing of specific Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIAs) related to COVID-19, looking at key identified areas and specific vulnerable groups of children including those in institutional care, in detention/closed institutions, affected by violence, involved in child labour or caught in migration.
In this context, ENOC will develop a Common Framework of Reference (CFR) and will train and guide the National Ombudspersons, on the methodology of the Assessment and assure the quality of the reporting.
The Office of the Deputy Ombudswoman for Children in Greece, is mandated to monitor and follow up on the implementation of international conventions for child rights, and based on these observations, develop and submit proposals to the Government for regulatory changes that aim to reinforce provisions for improved child rights implementation. As part of this mandate it is required to report on the situation and implementation of the rights of all children in Greece. The Office works in cooperation with the European Network for Ombudspersons (ENOC) which this year is Chaired by the Greek Deputy Ombudswoman and will actively participate in the assessment.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, 

Greece, as one of the primary entry points to Europe, has received over a million refugees and migrants since 2016 from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. As of September 2020, there were approximately 120,000 refugees and migrants living in Greece, of which, 33,000 are school-aged (4-17 years old), including nearly 4,000 unaccompanied children1.
Under the Greek law2, all children of compulsory school age, regardless of their legal status, have access to public school. In addition, access to school for children of the applicants of international protection must not be delayed more than three months after the completion of the full registration of their application for international protection by Greek authorities. In 2016, recognizing the additional needs of new arrivals in the country the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs (MoE) launched a refugee education programme by introducing second-shift, Reception Facilities for Refugee Education (DYEP) in Greek schools for all refugee and migrant children of compulsory school-age (4-15 years old3) living in reception and accommodation sites. Refugee students living in urban areas were enrolled in public school's regular classes in the morning, some of which were complemented with the support of reception classes.
Despite these efforts, according to the most recent assessment4, out of the 33,000 school-age children, only 42% (13,800) were enrolled in Greek public schools during the 2019-2020 school year. However, this school year has seen a significantly deteriorated situation for access to school, partially due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Moreover, most of the refugee and migrant children in schools face difficulties to be included and learn. Although there are many dedicated teachers that strive to respond to the needs of the refugee and migrant children, having foreign students who have missed several years of school and who do not understand the Greek language, especially in secondary schools, is a serious challenge for any teacher.
UNICEF aims to ensure that refugee and migrant children benefit of inclusive, equitable, quality education, through teacher trainings; educational and psychosocial programs for children and their families; development of tools addressing the needs of this population; and active cooperation with the Ministry of Education, the Institute of Educational Policy, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum, NGOs and other stakeholders.

How can you make a difference?

With a view of improving inclusion of refugee and migrant children to school, supporting teachers and educators to respond to the specific needs of these groups and strengthening the effectiveness and quality of UNICEF intervention, the Consultant will undertake the following key tasks:
• Assess training needs for the educators of the Non-Formal Education teams in the context of the Sites Management Support (SMS) lead by IOM and co-lead by UNICEF.
• Design and organize a series of trainings for educators of non-formal education programs and formal education teachers on different aspects of teaching methodologies and practices, such as teaching in multi-cultural classes, second languate teaching, differentiated learning, blended learning.
• Support the development and implementation of harmonized approach of non-formal educational programs aiming to support the successful integration of refugee and migrant children to school, in particular in the context of the Site Management Program lead by IOM and co-lead by UNICEF.
• Support UNICEF education team to enhance the use of the Akelius platform and other UNICEF tools for the inclusion of refugee and migrant children to schools and the strengthening of language learning.
• Liaise with the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Institute of Education Policy (IEP) to identify needs for trainings, educational material and tools to support the inclusion of refugee and migrant students in schools.
• Consolidate best practices and tools for the inclusion of refugee and migrant children in schools in cooperation with UNICEF partners, the MoE and the IEP.
Provide technical support to the Ministry of Education, Institute of Educational Policy on the development of tools and materials to strengthen inclusive education.
• Adapt Toolkits, Guides and Educational Material developed by UNICEF worldwide to be used in the Greek context.
• Contribute to the development of strategies on the inclusion of refugee and migrant children to school in cooperation with the Education team of UNICEF.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, innovate...
UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.
The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:

Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.
Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.
Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.

The Office of Innovation currently co-hosts the Secretariat for the Digital Public Goods Alliance, established in follow-up to the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. DPGs are defined as open source sofware, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content. In its report, the Panel recommends as 1B “that a broad, multi-stakeholder alliance, involving the UN, create a platform for sharing digital public goods, engaging talent and pooling data sets, in a manner that respects privacy, in areas related to attaining the SDGs”. Norway, Sierra Leone, UNICEF and iSPIRT, the four initial champions are working to implement this recommendation.
As one of the four co-champions, UNICEF is leading the Alliance’s engagement on select strategic areas.
How can you make a difference?
Among a focus on frontier technology, piloting of new infrastructure for DPGs and support to country-level pathfinding activities, UNICEF is exploring the potential and applications of private financing sources for creating sustainable DPG business models. Financing sources for consideration could include those with an interest in supporting commercial models with a potential for financial returns, such as investment funds, individuals, development banks and accelerators.We are aiming to strengthen the case for private investment into DPGs, based on robust financial analysis and investment cases.
This includes the exploration of sustainable (and profitable) business models for DPGs, the documentation of successful investment models, engagement with potential private financers and establishment of a working group on sustainable financing for DPGs. You will work closely with the DPG Alliance Secretariat and Alliance collaborators, as well as UNICEF Innovation’s Venture Fund and Innovative Financing teams, to engage investors and funds in the efforts to identify, pilot and scale digital public goods.
Your main responsibilities will be:

Document successful business models adopted by DPGs (with a focus on those aligned most closely with UNICEF’s priorities in frontier tech and mandate), that provide a financially sustainable pathway to growth
Identify investors and funds for the DPG Alliance to engage with on the topic of investments in DPGs in  Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs)
Convene an advisory group of funds and investors to identify key challenges, opportunities and investment considerations from the perspective of investors
Develop investment cases for DPGs at different stages of growth
Propose a longer term engagement strategy for UNICEF and the DPG Alliance with funds and investors to increase capital for DPGs

Purpose of Activity: 
UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to protect the rights of every child. Defending children's rights throughout their lives requires a global presence, aiming to produce results and understand their effects. UNICEF believes all children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfil their potential - to the benefit of a better world. Every year an estimated three quarters of the world’s children experience some form of violence. In humanitarian settings throughout the world, the dual burden of being female and young relegates adolescent girls to the margins of society where they are largely invisible, unheard and deprived of their basic human rights.  Many forms of gender-based violence (GBV) — including sexual exploitation and abuse, trafficking, rape, early marriage, female genital mutilation/ cutting, sexual harassment and honour killing — are directed at girls. Data show that in societies across the world, gendered discrimination and inequitable gender norms and systems are much more likely to limit girls’ ability to go to school, live free from violence, self-direct their life course, and enjoy a level of social status and value equal to that of their brothers and male peers.
Adolescent girls are uniquely disadvantaged during humanitarian crises, protracted displacement and the aftermath of such emergencies. Not only do emergencies increase the risk of GBV for adolescent girls; they also increase their health risks, diminish their educational opportunities, and expose them to other rights violations. 
UNICEF is directly involved in addressing gender-based violence (GBV) in some of the world’s most intense and complex conflicts and disasters. GBV in its various forms constitutes a global crisis which undermines social and economic progress; as one of the world’s greatest human rights violations, GBV must be addressed to ensure universal rights and principles regarding equality, security, liberty, integrity and dignity of human beings. Preventing and responding to gender-based violence in emergencies (GBViE) is recognized as a life-saving measure and an essential component of humanitarian action.
As a lead agency in addressing GBViE, UNICEF has expanded its on-the-ground programming in recent years and made prevention of and response to GBViE one its targeted priorities in its Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2018-2021. The GAP is integrally linked to UNICEF’s Strategic Plan (SP) and provides a clear programmatic focus on the gender-equitable results that UNICEF aims to achieve across all areas of its SP. UNICEF is also a leading agency in the development of programming and tools related to GBViE, including supporting the development of the Call to Action Roadmap, the implementation of a multi-country GBViE evaluation, the implementation of the revised IASC GBV Guidelines (2015)). In 2019, UNICEF launched its Gender-based Violence in Emergencies Operational Guide, a document that outlines the Agency’s vision and approach to GBViE, along with a GBViE Programme Resource Pack that contains practical tools for implementing GBViE programming. Both the Operational Guide and the Programme Resource Pack reflect UNICEF’s three-pillar approach to GBViE programming – services for survivors, community-based prevention and integration of GBV risk mitigation across other sectors’ interventions.
UNICEF has a track record of leadership and innovation in the development of GBViE knowledge, evidence, programming and tools. It will continue to build evidence and learning on what works in addressing GBV in emergencies. Research will complement existing initiatives and learning efforts in the sector to better understand and address the problem of GBViE, building on existing collaborations with Columbia and Johns Hopkins Universities. In 2020, the global community will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995). A five-year milestone will be reached towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 2020 is therefore a pivotal year for the accelerated realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, everywhere.
Safe spaces for women and girls have been established as a key approach of reaching adolescent girls and providing them with key information, links to services, skills-building, peer connection, and support. Yet, access to physical safe spaces is often limited for adolescent girls because of security concerns, gender norms, and domestic responsibilities. UNICEF has been developing a platform to act as a virtual safe space for adolescent girls to access gender-based violence information. The virtual safe space model is designed to facilitate access to information and services in a way that is safe, culturally appropriate and accessible to adolescent girls, particularly those who face higher levels of marginalization, such as girls with disabilities and married girls. Piloting of the virtual safe space platform has taken place in Iraq and Lebanon with adolescent girls, their female parents/caregivers and female staff working at traditional (“static”) safe spaces. Adolescent girls provided feedback throughout the piloting phase, and UNICEF is now ready to update the platform to incorporate the needs and preferences they have expressed as well as adding new content.
UNICEF is now working to create a revised version of the VSS that puts the safety of the adolescent girls and women at the forefront, broadening the scope of the content, and building in new interactive elements.  In the context of COVID-19 pandemic – and the limitations on gathering in physical safe spaces – there has been even more demand to expand this platform to be accessed by adult women as well. In addition, the platform will be expanded to cover topics beyond Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) into GBV, life skills, self-care and empowerment.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child,
In Ghana, UNICEF cooperates with the Government and other partners to defend the rights of children and help them fulfill their potential. With offices in Accra and Tamale, the UNICEF team seeks to achieve results in strategic programme areas. The overall goal is for every child to survive and thrive, to live in a safe and clean environment, to learn, to be protected from violence and exploitation, and to have an equitable chance in life. The current Country Programme of cooperation is aligned with the Government priorities, the UN Sustainable Development Partnership (UNSDP), and Key Results for Children (KRCs) in the West and Central African Region (immunization, nutrition, learning outcomes, ending child marriage, and ending open defecation). UNICEF main strategies include evidence-based advocacy, system strengthening, integrated programming across sectors, emergency preparedness and response, and innovation
How can you make a difference?
In collaboration with the international consultant, provide technical assistance to Ghana Health Service to develop a revised national newborn, child and adolescents health behaviour change communication, advocacy and social accountability strategies and five-year workplan
Despite tremendous progress made globally over the previous two decades, there is still a great deal to be done in further reducing preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths. Ghana has made some progress, but considering the current rate of decline in mortalities, based on the trajectory, the country is unlikely to meet its SDG targets for 2030, without major investments to improve quality healthcare services for every woman and every child. The COVID 19 pandemic has also threatened to rollback progress made due to disruption in provision of essential reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, adolescent health and nutrition services. UNICEF and WHO with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is supporting the Ghana Health Service to implement a maternal and newborn quality of care (QoC) initiative in line with the National maternal and newborn quality of care roadmap and guidelines. This quality of care initiative is consistent with the Ghana Health Service implementation guidelines for the National Healthcare Quality Strategy, National newborn health strategy and action plan (2019-2023), the Global Every Newborn Action Plan and the Global Quality of Care Network strategic objectives with the overall goal of contributing to the reduction of maternal mortality, still births and neonatal mortality by 50% by 2022 in implementing health facilities and districts. One of the four objectives of the Network for improving quality of care for maternal, newborn and child health is to develop, strengthen and sustain institutions and mechanisms for accountability for quality of care.
Accountability is one of the three pillars of the “Every Woman Every Child” architecture to support country-led implementation of the Global Strategy towards achieving the SDGs. There is commitment from the Ghana Health Service leadership around the implementation and scale up of the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) and community scorecard as an accountability tool, including strengthening effective community engagement and social and behaviour change communication activities at all levels in order to improve maternal, newborn and child survival. The Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescent’s Health (2016–2030) envisions a world in which every woman, child and adolescent living in every setting realises their rights to physical and mental health and well-being, has social and economic opportunities, and is able to participate fully in shaping prosperous and sustainable societies.
 
Tasks To be Completed are:

Review national evidence, policies, strategies, best practices and approaches in communication, advocacy and social accountability for newborn, child and adolescent health.
Conduct key informant interviews with stakeholders on the progress of implementation of the National newborn and child health communication and advocacy strategy (2015-2019) and National Reproductive health behaviour change communication strategy (2015-2020) and relevant workplans, and the extent to which the strategy considered equity and gender dynamics affecting MNCH.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
Background
In line with the Government’s national development plans, sectoral priorities and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2021-2025, the new UNICEF Country Programme will include a stronger focus on exclusion and inequalities with a vision to realise the rights of every child. The 2021-2025 Child Protection Programme has been conceptualized with consideration of UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and two strategic priorities on effective governance and justice for all, and Inclusive human capital development leading to health, well-being and resilient prosperity. These align with Outcomes 1 and 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework of Uzbekistan, which are fully aligned with national priorities to support the Government to achieve the national SDGs.
The long-term vision for change in the area of child protection is to ensure that by 2025, the most vulnerable children, including children from disadvantaged and low-income families, children at early ages and those with disabilities benefit from a protective environment that prevents separation of children from families and deprivation of liberty, and effectively responds to violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect.
In 2019, UNICEF in partnership with the larger EU-funded cross-regional project ‘Protecting children affected by migration in Southeast, South and Central Asia’ has conducted a study on ‘Effects of migration on children of Uzbekistan’. The study report findings show that in Uzbekistan, children left behind often stay with their extended family members, with adult relatives acting as caregivers, when one or both parents migrate. Such children may face developmental, psychosocial and emotional challenges, since the absence of parents creates disruptions and displacement in care giving arrangements. Parental migration has detrimental effects on the education, health and social status of children as well. It can lead to early adulting of the child due to increased household duties and responsibilities which can affect eating habits, academic performance and cause depression. The full study report on ‘Effects of migration on children in Uzbekistan’, UNICEF (2019) is available at: https://www.unicef.org/uzbekistan/en/reports/study-report-effects-migration-children-uzbekistan
One of the lessons learned from the previous Country Programme is that to make further progress in realising children's rights, there is a need to measure the impact of national policies, plans and services on the most disadvantaged families and children. Stronger national monitoring capacity will help build the accountable systems needed to adjust to rapid changes, including in crisis situations, such as seen with the COVID-19 pandemic.
UNICEF is aware that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children goes far beyond any health risks. Measures used to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus can for example expose children to additional protection risks. Disruptions to families, friendships, schooling and the wider community can have negative consequences on children’s well-being, development and protection. In this context, in May 2020, ENOC and UNICEF conducted a short online survey on Ombudspersons and Commissioners for Children’s responses to the new challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently organized an online discussion. 
Following up on the above and the ongoing collaboration, UNICEF ECARO proposes to further partner with ENOC to support national child rights mechanisms to assess key identified areas and specific vulnerable groups of children including those in institutional care, in detention/closed institutions, affected by violence involved in child labour, and affected by migration. Through this cooperation project, UNICEF will support ENOC to provide direct technical assistance (through webinars, and bi-lateral quality assurance) to a number of Ombudspersons for Children’s Offices in Europe and Central Asia for the undertaking and completing of specific Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIAs) related to COVID-19  including the Child Rights Ombudsman  of Uzbekistan for the undertaking and completing of specific Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIAs) related to COVID-19. ENOC will develop a Common Framework of Reference (CFR) and will train and guide the National Ombudspersons, on the methodology of the Assessment and assure the quality of the reporting. 
Objectives
The Child Rights Impact Assessments (CRIA) will enable the Child Rights Ombudsman office in Uzbekistan (CRO) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on children affected by migration (i.e. left behind by migrant parents). This initiative will strengthen the overall capacities of the CRO in monitoring child rights. The assessment will contribute to lessons learnt for the decision-makers to ensure better preparedness and capability to respond effectively to a similar challenge in the future. The findings of the CRIA will allow the CRO to dialogue with the Government of Uzbekistan to inform their respective processes with regard to child rights.
UNICEF in Uzbekistan will support the CRO to strengthen their capacities in conducting a CRIA as a contribution to the overall UNICEF ECARO-ENOC initiative. To this end, UNICEF Uzbekistan Office is looking for a qualified individual consultant to provide their professional expertise in support of the CRIA exercise.

UNICEF works to ensure the rights of all children in the East Asia and Pacific Region.  This means the rights of every child living in this country, irrespective of their nationality, gender, religion or ethnicity, to:

survival – to basic healthcare, peace and security;
development – to a good education, a loving home and adequate nutrition;
protection – from abuse, neglect, trafficking, child labour and other forms of exploitation; and
participation – to express opinions, be listened to and take part in making any decisions that affect them

 
How can you make a difference?
The Regional Communication section, UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO) is seeking an individual consultant to provide technical support on Communication and Community Engagement for the introduction of COVID 19 vaccine(s) in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Region.
 
Background:
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak has infected millions of people across the world and caused significant loss of lives. To protect people from the disease, vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed by several manufacturers in a number of countries.  It is expected that there will be only limited number of vaccines produced in the early days, and gradually scaled up. Hence, countries will need to prioritize population who will receive the vaccine in the first round.
There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues.  Community trust is key to ensure vaccine uptake and buy-in. To build trust, it is important to understand how communities perceive the disease and what are their main questions, doubts, and fears around vaccines, generally, and towards COVID-19 vaccine, more specifically. Previous experience of pandemics and communities’ risk perception about the disease can also influence vaccine uptake. Lack of trust in service providers, past negative experience of vaccination and poor quality of services including negative attitude of service providers may also affect the decision to accept a new vaccine in certain contexts. Similarly, it will be important to understand the trusted source of vaccine, influencers, etc.
It will be important for countries to have a good advocacy communication and social mobilization (ACSM) plan in line with Government’s decision of prioritization of population. The ACCSM plan will have a strong community engagement component, include social listening and community feedback mechanism and evidence-based communication approaches.
Families and communities need to be provided with accurate and up to date information on COVID-19 vaccine, based on evidence generated from social listening and behavior and social data, which will include clarification about eligible population and importance of continuing associated behaviours to prevent infection and transmission-engaging communities throughout the process. Demand generation interventions will need to encourage eligible populations to be vaccinated and at the same time manage public expectations on vaccine availability.

If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
For every child, Results
Administrative data is routinely derived, structured information from systems such as Health Information Systems (HIS), Education Information Management Systems, Social welfare registries, Civil registration and national identification systems, court record systems etc. These routinely collected administrative data are an essential source of data for governments and development partners to monitor progress against the SDGs and ensure that decision makers have the data they need to plan and deliver the programmes required to achieve the SDG targets. It is no longer sufficient for these systems to be siloed within sectors as many of the conditions required for strong national administrative data systems are cross-cutting. Furthermore, administrative data systems are seeing rapidly evolving changes in technology, digitization, and associated governance structures. As a result, data are increasingly able to be linked in new ways allowing us to do more with these routinely collected data than ever before.
The value of administrative data sources has particularly been highlighted during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Well-functioning systems that are able to deliver continuous, reliable, information on the provision, use and users of national services are invaluable to governments and partners in order to understand the impacts of such events and adjust service provision accordingly. The ability to monitor changes over time is critical in such events.
The administrative data portfolio at UNICEF has three key pillars that demand support during this maternity cover:

Build UNICEF capacity to effectively support administrative data system strengthening – both within and across key sectors, including uptake of best-practice examples.
Support improved use of administrative data at UNICEF.
In line with the UNICEF strategic plan, provide a coordination role to assist UNICEF to more strategically engage with external partners on administrative data and systems, and related issues.

In addition, the position plays a key role in supporting responsible data practice and data sharing more broadly across the organization, particularly as these overlap with best practice in terms of Administrative data.
How can you make a difference?

Oversee and manage two consultants and a Junior Professional Officer supporting the combined portfolio of Administrative data, Data sharing, and Responsible Data for Children.
Continue to coordinate and work through UNICEF’s Administrative Data Task Team to strengthen collaboration and better support UNICEF's core strengths and potential added value in relation to administrative data.
In collaboration with the Admin Data Task Team and D&A colleagues, build a body of resources to assist country office colleagues work effectively with Administrative data.
Review and strengthen guidance including, but not limited to the Administrative data maturity model; and support country offices in the uptake/ use of available best practice and guidance.
Provide guidance and support that underpins appropriate data use and system design (including technology; and responsible data use and protection), and implementation at the country level.
Provide support to sectoral colleagues (such as the EMOPS team) to review development plans (in particular with respect to data needs, flows, use, and management) for new or revised Administrative data systems.
Work with D&A colleagues to strengthen administrative data assessment in the data action planning work.

To qualify as an advocate for every child you will have…

Masters degree in statistics, or equivalent data-related field; OR
Bachelors degree in statistics (or equivalent) may be considered sufficient with 10+ years relevant experience in a national or regional statistics office/ official (government) data role.

Strong experience working with administrative data systems (in health, education, civil registration, social welfare etc.), including functional identity and data linkage. This should include system design, evaluation and data use. Cross-sectoral experience is considered desirable.
Proven research skills (including qualitative analysis and study design) and demonstrated record of peer-reviewed publications and/or technical publication.
Experience formulating guidance documents and tools, including training or advocacy on data related issues. A solid understanding of UNICEF's core areas of work and familiarity with the UN statistical community

Social sciences can support community engagement in humanitarian contexts. For example, during the West Africa Ebola epidemic, anthropologists made essential contributions for identifying issues around safe and dignified burials, which helped inform development of partnerships and social mobilization and community engagement interventions that supported decreasing transmission. Six years later, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, social sciences is being leveraged to inform not just community engagement, but all the pillars of epidemic response (health-seeking behaviours, testing, vaccine distribution). In humanitarian settings, however, the social sciences remain, to date, an insufficiently tapped resource. Social sciences intelligence, insights and analysis can be developed into distinct public goods in humanitarian contexts. Social sciences is joined to community engagement through its explicit focus on the social, cultural, and structural determinants of human development outcomes, a deep focus on the drivers of human behaviour, and a commitment to human rights and public accountability. Community engagement, in turn, plays an essential role in the actions and services that ensure that these considerations can be translated into operational and functional systems approaches from policy level to the frontlines.
Despite these clear intersections, there are issues in the interface between social sciences and community engagement in humanitarian contexts. The result, to date, has been a limited integration of social sciences contributions into community engagement practice, which has implications across all the humanitarian pillars.
Currently there are specific clearly defined contributions that UNICEF C4D has leveraged resources to undertake within a recently launched initiative. This specific initiative has an overall goal to strengthen global and regional demand and capacity for social science integration into community engagement to respond adaptively, rapidly, and accurately in humanitarian emergencies. The objectives are to:

improve social science research and analyses for community engagement.
expand social science contributions to community engagement and accountability to affected populations (AAP) in humanitarian action.
position uptake and use of social data for social science analysis for community engagement in humanitarian action.

The initiative also has a specific timeline from Octo 2020 through March 2022, during which there will be opportunities for leveraging further resources and specially to take forward implementation initiatives with partners at the operational level, namely regional and country level collaborations.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates the commitment of children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
In line with Every Child Learns, the 2020-2030 UNICEF Global Education Strategy, the Education Section leads global efforts for development of evidence-based policy guidance, standard setting and programme approaches, including a focus on enabling children and young people to progress through three key “transition points” duriUNICEF is committed to diversity and inclusion within its workforce, and encourages all candidates, irrespective of gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality, culture, appearance, socio-economic status, ability, age, religious and ethnic backgrounds to apply to become a part of the organization. ng their learning journey:
•            By 5 years old – every child is “school ready”, setting in motion a positive cycle of learning throughout a child’s life;
•            By 10 years old – every child has the basic reading and numeracy skills to access the academic curriculum (i.e. transitions from ‘learning to read” to “reading to learn”); and,
•            By 18 years old – every child has the transferable, digital, entrepreneurial and job-specific skills for work, life and engagement in their communities.
As part of these efforts, the Education Section is implementing a Foundational Literacy and Numeracy strategy which aims to increase number of children mastering foundational literacy and numeracy skill by 54 million by 2030.  The FLN programme aims to recommit and focus UNICEF’s efforts on improving foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) skills for every child. This laser-sharp focus on FLN is anchored in four key elements: leaders who lead; teachers who teach; learners who learn; and parents who prioritize. As part of the programme, UNICEF will work alongside a coalition of partners at global and country levels drawing on global, regional and country-level expertise, key resources and tools to define country-specific FLN outputs to support and guide implementation at country level. The work will start in “early adopter” countries and gradually expand to other countries that express interest in the approach.
The FLN initiative forms part of the broader efforts to strengthen programming on primary education which also gives emphasis to strengthening school health and nutrition and improving delivery at scale of climate and environment education. These are in addition to the multiplicity of ways in which UNICEF supports governments to improve primary education including curriculum reform, data systems, strategic planning and teaching and learning resources. These form the body of work done by the primary education and which have become more urgent given the likely negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning. In order to ensure increased pace and quality of implementation of the primary education portfolio at global level, additional human resources are required.

PURPOSE OF ASSIGNMENT

L'un des plus grands défis des programmes de transferts sociaux pour les ménages vulnérables est l'identification et la sélection des ménages. En général, les analyses de la pauvreté sont fondées sur des termes monétaires (ligne de pauvreté). Le ménage est considéré comme pauvre si son revenu ou sa consommation est inférieur à un seuil de pauvreté prédéfini. Ces mesures ne parviennent pas à reconnaître le caractère multidimensionnel de la pauvreté, ignorant la perception et la compréhension de la pauvreté par les membres de la communauté, les laissant sans voix dans le processus d’identification. Conscient de cela, UNICEF dans le cadre de l’assistance technique au MINAS, est en train d’appuyer le developpement d’une méthode de ciblage mixte combinant le méthode de ciblage Proxy Means Test (PMT) et le ciblage communautaire pour impliquer les membres de la communauté afin de mieux définir la pauvreté «perçue», en l’utilisant comme un élément clé de la sélection des ménages pauvres.
Dans ce cadre, UNICEF cherche à recruter un consultant individuel pour (i) faire une analyse et profil de la vulnérabilité et (ii) estimer les le score d’éligibilité et le seuil d’éligibilité suivant la méthode PMT.


OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK 


L’objectif principal de conduire une analyse globale de la vulnérabilité visant à classer provinces en utilisant les mesures existantes (pauvreté monétaire, multidimensionnelle, insécurité alimentaire) et d’estimer les paramètres pour un PMT qui permettra de classer bénéficiaires des programmes de protection sociale.
Ce travail sera réalisé à partir de sources d’information secondaires comprenant entre autres, les enquêtes nationales (budget et consommation des ménages ; MICS, EDS et toute autre enquête pertinentes existante) les plus récentes.
Le consultant effectuera les travaux en étroite collaboration avec le MINAS et l’Institut National de Statistique (INS). Des ateliers techniques seront organisés avec les cadres techniques spécialistes de la collecte et de l’analyse de données sur les ménages concernant la pauvreté et les méthodes de ciblage.
  


Identifier et examiner les ensembles de données existants sur la pauvreté monétaire et non monétaire des ménages.


Conduire une revue documentaire et analyse des publications existantes dans le domaine.

Utiliser le questionnaire standard d’éligibilité (QSE) développé par le MINAS pour identifier des variables pertinentes corrélées à la pauvreté facile à quantifier, vérifier et difficile à falsifier afin d’élaborer une formule PMT pour le milieu urbain et une autre pour le milieu rural.


Estimer les paramètres d’un PMT pour la RDC sur la base des analyses précédentes tout en tenant compte de la catégorisation rural et urbain 


Utiliser les bases de données des programmes existant pour tester la robustesse des paramètres de la formule et l’efficacité de la méthode de ciblage (couverture, erreurs d’inclusion et d’exclusion).


Proposer des méthodes de collecte ainsi qu’un modèle de question à intégrer dans les futures opérations d’enquête


Développer un manuel technique d’utilisation et application du PMT.

UNICEF is committed to diversity and inclusion within its workforce, and encourages all candidates, irrespective of nationality, religious and ethnic backgrounds, gender identity and sexual orientation, as well as persons living with disabilities, to apply to become a part of the organization. UNICEF’s office is accessible to a certain extent, and employees are entitled to reasonable accommodations that are needed for ensuring equitable working conditions.
Providing quality education for all children, regardless of their background, is one of the top priorities for UNICEF. Our goal is to enable the most vulnerable and marginalized children to realize their full potential through accessing and completing quality inclusive education.
The results of the 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in Serbia indicate gaps in equitable access to quality education between the general population and children from minority and vulnerable groups. This is hampered by a variety of reasons, including the lack of resources and capacity to support additional needs, but also by negative attitudes towards children with disabilities and children from minority groups. The implementation and realization of inclusive education (IE) is therefore of key significance for the realization of child and human rights, social inclusion and human capital development. 
UNICEF supports the Government of Serbia in realizing the inclusive education principles through different initiatives including technical assistance to policy and governance work, research initiatives and analytical work, and planning towards building a more inclusive education system.
Work Assignment Overview:

Duration of the assignment: March 2021 – December 2022 (part-time)
Tasks:

Support the communication and C4D analysis related to inclusive quality education (nature of the problem, education provision, community attitudes and public perceptions – including teachers, parents, government, the public; the media landscape);
Support communication planning and setting communication objectives for social and behaviour change;
Assist in the development and execution of the communication strategy and promotion for social and behavioural change in the area of inclusive quality education;
Assist in the development and execution of communication action plan for quality inclusive education;
Support monitoring and evaluation of communication planning

Required qualifications:

A university degree in one of the following fields: social and behavioural science, sociology, anthropology, psychology, education, communication, media, public relations, marketing or another relevant field.
A minimum of five years of professional experience in one or more of the following areas is required: social development, communication for development, behavioural and social change, social marketing, public advocacy, or another related area.
A recent professional experience in media, marketing and/or social mobilization.

Title of Assignment: Solution Architecture for Education Digitalization and Integration of Education Information Management System (EMIS)
Category of the Consultancy: International or National Individual Consultancy
Proposed level of Consultancy: Senior
Section: Education
Location: Kigali, Rwanda
Duration: 6 months
Start date: From: 1 April 2021    To: 30 September 2021
How can you make a difference?
Background An Integrated Education Management Information System (IEMIS) is a critical tool for providing the education sector with accurate and relevant information to inform its policy decisions and implementation approaches. Although the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) and its agencies have data and information systems in place, inefficiencies in those systems reduce the effectiveness of planning, management and decision-making processes and, ultimately, compromise the quality, sustainability and equity in education.
In 2019, MINEDUC with support from UNICEF, conducted an in-depth analysis of the education sector business structure and processes, with focus on data needs and utilization, as well as information systems and the technology architectures currently in use. The aim of the study was to lay foundation for the establishment of an Integrated Education Management Information System (IEMIS).
The study pointed out the existence of multiple systems that collect the same data multiple times from the same source (redundancy), which leads to the fact that current applications, systems and technologies are:• Only meeting some of the needs of various education institutions, but are inadequate to support the overall education business structure and processes;• Implemented without regard to common standards and an interoperability framework.
Consequently, MINEDUC in partnership with UNICEF, and through the support from MasterCard Foundation, is aiming to improve the overall education management information system by addressing issues related to covering the full business processes re-engineering and automation needs in the sector taking into consideration students, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders journeys at different levels of the education system. To achieve this aspiration, a digitalization roadmap for the education sector is being developed to guide future investment in the sector.
In this regard, an experienced Solution Architect is being recruited to contribute to the development of the digitalization roadmap through a comprehensive analysis and design of: • Functional, and non-functional requirements of the future IEMIS• Information architecture for the IEMIS (Data architecture including production, analysis, information accessibility and use, application architecture including software models); • Infrastructure architecture for the IEMIS (technology, networks, ….).
The consultant is expected to produce a detailed solution architecture and a related project implementation guide for an Integrated Education Management Information System (IEMIS) which will automate identified manual processes and improve on the automated ones for a better service delivery and education related data management. The consultant will also complement and work with the team in charge of developing the digital transformation roadmap of the education sector.
JustificationOne of the key strategic priorities in the Rwanda Education Sector Strategic Plan 2018-2023 (ESSP) is to strengthen governance and accountability across all levels of education in Rwanda. Specifically, MINEDUC is focusing its efforts on, among others, improving data collection and management processes in order to ensure relevant and efficient planning processes and accountability between the local, district and national levels. The present technical assistance is directly aligned with priorities identified in the ESSP and responds directly to needs identified in the Rwanda education sector by the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC), its agencies, the University of Rwanda, district and sector education units, schools, development partners, and other relevant stakeholders. It will provide support to the education system and a clear impetus for strengthening the analysis, dissemination, accessibility and use of education data.

BACKGROUND:
The Government of Jordan launched the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS 2019-2025) in May 2019. The strategy aims at enhancing coverage and better outcomes for the most vulnerable groups through improved targeting, strengthened institutional capacity, and enhanced coordination. In this perspective, the strategy represents an overarching framework to maximize synergies and ensure effective integrated approaches by considering the following areas of the SP system: social assistance, social services, social insurance, and labour market policies.
The strategy is organized around three pillars – collectively directed at a decent life for targeted groups – through provision of a comprehensive, transparent and equitable social protection system.  The first pillar focuses on opportunities for families to be economically self-sufficient through the labor market.  The second pillar focuses on empowerment of the population through education, health care and protection services that support those with special needs remain integrated into their families and communities.  The third pillar focuses on targeted social assistance that allows the poor to maintain a basic level of consumption with dignity.
The implementation of the Social Protection Strategy is supervised by a Steering Committee led by Minister of Social Development (MOSD) and consists of high-level representatives from relevant ministries and civil society organizations. The implementation will be supported with an Implementation Support Unit (ISU) that will be based at the MoSD and reports to the steering committee. The ISU will include technical teams which will oversee multiple thematic technical committees, support the resources mobilization and partnership, coordinate with the governmental entities, and undertake the monitoring and evaluation activities. The establishment of Unit is part of a larger EU-MADAD supported program led by UNICEF and ILO to provide technical assistance and facilitate the implementation of the Strategy.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Protection 
UNICEF has a mandate to safeguard the rights of all children, which is rooted in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), applicable to every child, and since 2015 in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNICEF works in Europe and Central Asia to ensure that no child is left out of progress and plans to fulfil their rights and potential of development, that every child has a supportive family environment, access to justice and is protected from violence, abuse and exploitation. An important area of work of UNICEF consists of strengthening child protection systems to safeguard all children and their families from a full spectrum of risks.
UNICEF is leading the preparation of the Statistical Manual for a Core Set of Child Protection Indicators in Europe and Central Asia (not for wider circulation, to be shared upon request) that offers National Statistical Offices (NSOs), line Ministries and other child protection authorities and stakeholders, the practical guidance and tools for the collection of child protection data that is essential for monitoring the overall functioning and strength of child protection systems in countries across the region of Europe and Central Asia. The data and information generated by the proposed child protection indicators should be used by national governments, academia and civil society actors to identify the priority protection needs of children and the necessary prevention and responses to those needs, provide information to guide the national response including programme development and budgeting, and support advocacy to improve laws, policies, systems and services for children in need of protection. The data should be considered with available survey data (for instance from MICS, DHS or other surveys) and combined with qualitative data and information from key child protection stakeholders, including children themselves.
The first draft of the manual builds on the TransMonEE database indicators and manual, and is the result of an extensive desk review, and several consultations within UNICEF, governments and NSOs in the region, and with some external partners. During the TransMonEE meeting held in Vienna, 26- 27 November 2019, it was agreed among all the countries, that the first edition of 
the manual will be published in late 2020, upon the completion of in-depth testing of indicators that have not been collected in the TransMonEE database, so this will serve to validate the feasibility for countries to provide quality and timely data for those indicators and to fill in the gaps for those indicators that are not methodologically complex. The work on gaining greater methodological consensus or clarity on some complex indicators that have not been collected yet in the TransMonEE database, will require more time to resolve and will be pursued in parallel, within UNICEF and with other partners.
UNICEF in BiH will support key stakeholders from Government, in particular line ministries, as well as the BiH and entity statistic agencies, to strengthen Child Protection Data Systems through enhanced collection and use of Child Protection data, in areas of Access to Justice, Children in Residential and Family-based Care, Adoption and Violence Against Children.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
Background
In Uzbekistan HIV testing services (HTC) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) have been scaled up substantially. In 2018, 69% of all people living with HIV in Uzbekistan know their status, 42% of those who know their status have access to ART, 30% of those who on ART are virally suppressed However, it is far from 90-90-90 target, which was set up by Uzbekistan in 2016. Meanwhile, reaching the 90–90-90 targets very much depends on efficient and effective resource use to deliver HIV testing services.
Some specific bottlenecks, especially those that significantly increase the cost of testing for HIV, are the clear deterrents of the progress. Uzbekistan has an extensive network of laboratories that provide services required to fulfill and support the HIV/AIDS programme. Laboratories are structural subdivisions of AIDS Centers at the national (Republican), city (Tashkent city) and regional (14 regional) levels. Moreover, there are 63 inter-district laboratories operating in the country, reporting to regional AIDS centers, equipped with modern equipment and staffed by medical personnel. However, the resources of these laboratories are only partially used (carrying out screening tests for HIV infection).
In last publications WHO has recommended to encourage greater national commitment through implementing effective and efficient HTS as a vital element of the national HIV response, essential to achieve and maintain low HIV incidence. Creation of demand, revision of service delivery approaches by consulting with clinical experts and adopting those that are closing the testing gaps and contributing to the decline in HIV positivity in HTS programmes, are intended to make HTS more focused and finally increase the cost-effectiveness of Laboratory testing. 
In 5 years, Uzbekistan has to shift HIV financing out of the external donor support to domestic-funded. In this regard, more efficient use of existing resources, through regular resource allocation assessments, would make an essential contribution to addressing the funding gap.  
Thus, there is a need to evaluate efficiency of existing HIV Laboratories in Uzbekistan and propose optimized service delivery approaches in accordance to the WHO recommendations. For this purpose, UNICEF Country office in collaboration with Ministry of Health is hiring the International Consultant to evaluate efficiency of existing HIV Laboratories network in Uzbekistan and provide recommendations on improving lab efficiency.

For every child,
BackgroundTajikistan has high malnutrition rate in the Central Asia. Despite improvements over the last decade, undernutrition in Tajikistan remains a significant public health problem. In response, major efforts have been made by the Government and various donors through implementation of nutrition specific interventions such as promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, timely introduction of complementary feeding, salt iodization, management of acute malnutrition, and Vitamin A and micronutrient powder distribution. However, the 2017 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) identified that 21 percent of children under 5 years old are stunted, 6 percent are wasted, and 8 percent are underweight.
According to the 2016 Tajikistan Micronutrient Status Survey, the national median urinary iodine concentration (MUIC) for children 6-59 months and women of reproductive age (87.5 µg/L and 75 µg/L, respectively) was below the threshold value of 100 µg/L. For both groups, iodine concentration had fallen substantially since 2009. 41% of children were found to be anemic with around two in five children suffering from vitamin A deficiency (37.0%).   Major efforts have been made by the Government and various donors in responding to the problem of malnutrition in the country.  In 2019, the Government of Tajikistan approved a law on food fortification to address the micronutrient deficiencies among population, particularly among women and children in Tajikistan. In the framework of the implementation of the law, Ministry of Health and Social Protection initiated to develop a national programme and implementation plan on prevention of micronutrient deficiencies among population, particularly women and children. UNICEF committed to supporting the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population to development of the programme and the implementation plan.
In order to accelerate this process, UNICEF seeks a national expert to provide support to the MoHSPP technical working group for the development of the programme on prevention of micronutrient deficiencies among population, particularly women and children.     
PURPOSE: 
The proposed consultancy aims to provide technical support to the multisectoral technical working group set up by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection in finalizing of the national program on prevention of the micronutrient deficiencies among population, particularly women and children in Tajikistan.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
 The new proposed consultancy tasks will be mainly:
1.         To complete consultations with the technical committee and other relevant partners including the new identified stakeholders
2.         Providing technical advice to the key line ministries in reviewing and finalization of the programme and implementation plan.
3.         Prepare and provide the final document for approval
4.         Prepare a completion report for the completed tasks.
The consultant will work closely with UNICEF Tajikistan, the multisectoral technical working group of MoHSPP and other relevant partners to perform the assignments.

How can you make a difference?
 Major Tasks to be accomplished This consultancy is required to conduct the following key tasks to develop the advocacy and resource mobilization documents: 1. Preparation and presentation of the consultant’s detailed proposal and workplan on how to take the assignment and the production of the proposed deliverables forward. 2. Conduct of a desk review, interviews/meetings with the key stakeholders (LEG, Cluster Education, NGOs, MENPC) and overall analysis of the available ECW/MYRP Chad programme documents and reports, in order to understand the Chad education context, and the progress, results, strengths and weaknesses of the ECW/MYRP Programme so far, including analysis of funding gaps and the available data towards developing compelling advocacy and resource mobilization messages. This work should include cost-benefit analysis and cost-of-inaction analysis to develop a solid case to donors for investment in the Chad ECW/MYRP. The analysis could include some assessment on the aspects of risks and mitigation measures associated with investment and implementation and delivering services for education in emergencies in Chad, paying special attention to inclusion and gender considerations. The consultant can also use other existing literature, research studies and data, in order to:a) Answer the question: why invest in education and particularly ECW/MYRP in Chad. This may include analysis and messaging of the strengths, results, and progress of ECW/MYRP so far, and its comparative advantage, e.g. in terms of the COVID-19 response, the beneficiaries reached, the humanitarian/development nexus, joint programming, the MYRP model, etc.b) Integrate the information and estimated costs from the analysis into the case for investment, and to determine how much resources, for what and why are needed for ECW/MYRP.c) Determine the cost of not acting and not funding a programme such as ECW/MYRP in Chad3. Development of an overall broad vision and advocacy and resource mobilization strategy for ECW/MYRPin Chad, and its corresponding concrete and realistic fundraising implementation plan that suggests how to best take the strategy forward in practice, e.g. through specific actions and activities such as events, meetings, messaging and products that the ECW/MYRP partners should engage themselves in, for advocacy and resource mobilization. This should also include suggestions for targeting specific donors (traditional and non-traditional and/or the private sector actors) globally and in-country. Hence, some analysis of the donor profiles and donor prospects is needed, to identify the potential and best fit investors for Chad ECW/MYRP, to leverage the core and prospective donors and their existing and increased support for equity and gender in education. In summary, the implementation plan needs to illustrate how the financing and leveraging of resources are done to secure sufficient investments at the global and/or at the in-country level for Chad.4. Develop a financial investment case or business case to be shared electronically to advocate and ‘sell’ the Chad ECW/MYRP for resource mobilization and to be able to tell a convincing story to the interested donors.5. Based on the advocacy and resource mobilization strategy and the ‘business case’, develop short and concrete resource mobilization and advocacy templates and tools (‘marketing package’) for the ECW/MYRP partners, e.g. the following: 1. a key donor proposal , 2. a short and attractive advocacy document, 3. a factsheet, 4. a brochure/e-pamphlet, 5. guidance for external messaging, e.g. for Tweeting. The specific products and their format will be discussed and agreed between the consultant and the PMU.All developed products should respect the global ECW branding guidelines and the Chad ECW/MYRP communication guidelines, and other global ECW policies and guidelines. All activities will be carried out in a participatory and consultative manner.
Frequency of reports: The consultant will have weekly online meetings with the supervisor/PMU for reporting progress. No separate written progress reports will be required as the assignment is focused on and paid against the specific deliverables.Recourse: UNICEF/PMU reserves the right to withhold all or a portion of payment if performance is unsatisfactory, if work/outputs is incomplete, not delivered or for failure to meet deadlines.Estimated duration and tentative dates: Duration: 45 working days within a 3-month period, from the start date of the contractDates: 3 months from the start date of the contract, the estimated dates from 1st March 2021 to 30 May 2021.

Consultancy Title: Quantitative Research Analyst for Nutrition  
About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
Care for child wasting, known as Community Based Management for Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) follows a standardized treatment protocol approved by the WHO and implemented in over 40 countries worldwide. Children without complications are admitted for outpatient treatment based on specific anthropometric criteria (Middle Upper Arm Circumference, Weight for Height or Edema) and receive therapeutic products, alongside routine medication, which are administered at home with weekly visits to the health facility. The dosage of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) is based on the weight of the child at admission and is steadily increased over the course of recovery. Recovery is determined once a child achieves a certain anthropometric status. Whilst management for severe wasting is a routine service which should be available in all contexts where wasting occurs, management of moderate wasting depends on the context, whereby either children receive nutritional counselling or a supplementary product depending on the food security environment.
Over the last 5 years, several organisations have been adapting standard CMAM protocols to respond to contextual challenges in the implementation of the service. In some instances, these adaptations have been a result of emergency or humanitarian contexts which called for a simplification or harmonization of services in the face of issues around access and utilization of health services. In other instances, these adaptations have been attempting to resolve more systemic issues related to the service, such as costs and coverage. The commonality across all adaptations is the intention to render services more accessible, for a lower cost. In general terms, these adaptations are referred to as simplified approaches.
One of the modifications that UNICEF is keen to document and build evidence around is the modified RUTF dosage in the treatment of wasting. In Afghanistan in 2019 & 2020, as a result of operational constraints and issues related to supply, wasting treatment services were adapted in certain areas of the country. The dosage of RUTFs was simplified and reduced over the course of recovery. Admissions criteria were also simplified to a MUAC only criteria and expanded to admit children with severe and moderate wasting according to this criterion. This consultancy will support the final analysis of the data collected during this period of modifications and the write-up of these modifications into a scientific journal article.

Background:
Giga is a joint initiative of UNICEF and United Nations International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to connect every school to the internet, and every young person to information, opportunity and choice.
According to the ITU, nearly 3.7 billion people remain unable to access the internet and disconnected from digital solutions that could dramatically improve their lives. This limits them from accessing the same information, opportunity and choice as their more-connected peers. Unless things change, a big part of this rapidly growing group of young people is in danger of being left behind - excluded from the modern digital world.

 BACKGROUND 
The mission and goal of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) program in Guinea-Bissau is to contribute to the overall realization of the National Health Development Plan (PNDS) by reducing morbidity, mortality and disability due to vaccine preventable diseases and to ensure all children and high-risk group are fully vaccinated with high quality and effective vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases as per national and global standards. To achieve these goals, routine immunization services for children and pregnant women are provided through static, outreach and mobile sites and occasional special acceleration campaigns.
Immunization is the most widely accessed and successful child health intervention in use today in Guinea Bissau. But immunization coverage has stagnated at 88% of DPT3 over the last five years (WUENIC 2019), which is probably related to the general instability context resulting in the erosion of public services and systems. Also, these relative high rates mask inequities at the subnational level. At subnational level, 3 out of 11 regions has the DTP3 coverage less than 80 per cent in 2020. Around 8,000 children remained unvaccinated in Guinea-Bissau during 2019, more in 2020 with the COVID-19 context. More than 60% of those unvaccinated children are living in urban area, principally in the capital Bissau.
The study on equity in immunization conducted in 2017 showed that the major bottlenecks to immunization are: geographical access; continuity in use; quality of services, except for Bissau where the issues are quite different, more related to human resources capacity and economic activities of mothers. The study also helped identify underserved communities in each region for which specific efforts must be undertaken to reach every child. Major challenges remain in terms of insufficient allocation of human resources, coordination, outreach strategies, cold chain management and data collection.
Strategies to reach unvaccinated children have been developed and are being implemented.
To improve the amount, quality and use of available immunization data, Gavi launched and is implemented with country partners a strategic focus area for data that address three key areas:

Immunization delivery, coverage and equity: strengthening the quality of immunization coverage data to help address bottlenecks.
Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance: helping countries to strengthen their surveillance systems and use disease data to target and improve immunization programmes. VPD surveillance systems are also a vital part of ensuring global health security and outbreak preparedness.
Vaccine safety surveillance and response: establishing and improving data systems to detect adverse events and implement effective response and communication strategies.

Through their assistance, Vaccine Alliance partners are supporting new ways to use data to inform immunization programmes. This includes the production of various immunization coverage and equity analyses as well as targeted support for data improvement plans.
UNICEF is at the forefront of supporting the MOH in immunization data management, ensuring that all children are equitably reached, and would like to recruit three experienced national consultants to provide a technical insight to the country’s immunization team at national and regional level in this area, especially targeting the regions with low coverage.
