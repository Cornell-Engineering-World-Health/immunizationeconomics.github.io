22,Integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Illness (iCCM) Consultant,"Background The US President’s Malaria Initiative for States (PMI-S) project is a five-year USAID flagship malaria project managed by Management Sciences for Health (MSH) with consortium partners Thinkwell, Banyan Global and the Nigeria Interfaith Action Association (NIFAA). The project supports the Government of Nigeria through its agencies at the federal, state, local government areas (LGAs) and community levels to reduce under-five and maternal mortality by delivering quality services for the prevention and management of malaria and its complications. PMI-S Project is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract issued by the United States Agency for International Development to MSH on June 29, 2018. The project is being implemented at the national level and in eight Nigerian states through Task Orders. Task Order (TO) 02 supports federal level activities; TO 03 supports activities in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Ebonyi and Oyo states; while TO 04 supports activities in Benue, Nasarawa, Plateau and Zamfara states. The four main objectives of PMI-S are to: (i) Increase malaria test rates from 30% (2014 HMIS) to 85%, (ii) Provide appropriate malaria treatment according to the national treatment guidelines in at least 85% of parasitological confirmed malaria cases; (iii) Increase the number of pregnant women receiving three or more doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) through Directly Observed Therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or any other World Health Organization-approved drugs at antenatal clinics or at the community level through community IPTp from the 2013 NDHS level of 5.8% to at least 80%; and (iv) Increase access to appropriate treatment of malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea by 50% over 2015 levels in selected local government authorities through the integrated community case management approach. Consultancy Overview Nigeria adopted the integrated community case management (iCCM) strategy in 2012, aimed at expanding access to life-saving interventions to under-five children. The focus is to contribute to improving access to quality healthcare services to children under-five in the target communities. ICCM is an equity-focused strategy that provides timely treatment for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea at community level for populations with limited access to facility-based health care providers. This strategy is delivered by community level health providers who are trained, regularly supervised, and have access to uninterrupted supplies of commodities. However, in Nigeria, iCCM currently depends heavily on donor support, compromising its sustainability. PMI-S plans to support Ebonyi and Benue/Zamfara states to implement iCCM using a sustainable approach as part of efforts to improve access to quality health services for children at the community level. PMI-S will adopt relevant national guidelines and protocols as well as leveraging on lessons learned from iCCM projects implemented in Nigeria. In view of the above, PMI-S seeks the services of a consultant who will conduct a desk assessment of iCCM interventions implemented in Nigeria  to identify good /best practices, challenges, opportunities and lessons learned; and apply the findings to a deeper assessment of iCCM needs and opportunities in Ebonyi state under TO 03. The consultancy may be extended later to conduct deeper iCCM assessments in Benue and/or Zamfara states under TO 04. The deeper state iCCM assessments will include key Informant interviews with SMOH, SPHCDA, and LGA Officials, as well as WDCs and community leaders to identify underserved LGAs and communities that will benefit from iCCM interventions. This consultancy is specifically for the national level desk review of iCCM and an in-depth assessment of iCCM needs in Ebonyi state. The Consultant will carry out the following tasks: Specific tasks Task 1:  Develop a study protocol and obtain ethical approval from the respective authorities Task 2: Conduct a desk review of iCCM interventions implemented in Nigeria, to identify strategic approaches, good/best practices, challenges, opportunities and lessons learned. The consultancy will identify key elements to sustainability of iCCM implementation in the country. The review will cover a sample of iCCM interventions drawn from any states in Nigeria including Ebonyi, and will not be limited to only PMI-supported states. Task 3: Conduct a deeper assessment of Ebonyi state to determine which communities and populations would benefit most from implementation of iCCM services, and with what models of iCCM service-delivery. The consultant will gather information on the distribution of the malaria burden (by geography and age groups), gaps in access to health facility-based malaria services, and lessons from previous iCCM implementation in Ebonyi to guide the selection of LGAs /communities where iCCM may be implemented in the state. S/he will conduct key informant interviews with SMOH officers (Director of Public Health, Director of Pharmaceutical Services, SMEP Manager, and IMCI focal person), Executive Secretary SPHCDA, LGA health managers (PHC Coordinators, LGA malaria and IMCI focal persons), WDC members and other community leaders to identify underserved LGAs and communities that will benefit from iCCM interventions, and map potential resources to support iCCM implementation in the state. Task 4: Make recommendations on sustainable iCCM approaches in Nigeria and propose iCCM models that are most appropriate for Ebonyi state. Deliverables Submission of the study protocol and approval by PMI-S and the ethical review committee. A comprehensive report of the desk review of iCCM implementation in Nigeria including the selected state-specific components. A detailed iCCM assessment report for Ebonyi that includes a list of relevant management/coordination structures or contacts/stakeholders that can support iCCM implementation in the state.

39,"Consultant for the Development of the Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for the New National Malaria Strategic Plan","Background Malaria is endemic in Nigeria with 97% of the population at risk of infection sparing Sahel regions and the high mountainous area of the plateau. Nigeria contributes a quarter of the African malaria burden. It is a major public health problem in Nigeria; with up to 60% of all outpatients and 30% of admission are attributable to the disease. An estimated 110 million cases of malaria are said to occur annually with the greatest burden in children under five and pregnant women. Disease control, as well as other health and development programmes, has become result based. An effective Monitoring and Evaluation strategy is needed to measure adequacy and timeliness of inputs, progress, and tracking of achievement of set objectives. It provides sound evidence for decision making at programme and policy levels. Programmes/projects at all levels of implementation, whether they consist of multiple integrated projects or single interventions including public and private sectors, must conduct monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities.  The National Strategic Plan for Malaria Control in Nigeria (NMSP), 2021-2025, has outlined massive scaling up of intervention mixes for impact using granular subnational data Owing to such massive deployment of effective interventions, it is expected that the epidemiologic profile of malaria in the country will change. Rationale In addition to the expected improvement that such optimal scale up of interventions will bring to bear on malaria epidemiologic profile and subsequent transition to pre-elimination, the huge cost implications involved, the limited available resources, coupled with the enormous pressure to meet set targets within limited-time spans puts a prerogative on sound monitoring and periodic evaluation. This is crucial for identifying gaps in programme implementation or areas where modifications in specific technical strategies may be needed. In view of the above, the National M&E plan needs to provide robust guide for monitoring and evaluation of the strategic plan and to encourage implementers to focus on intended programme results. It should also serve as a tool for early identification of gaps and potential implementation bottlenecks. This will provide a basis for adjustments and reprogramming for improved outcomes.  In order to develop a robust M&E plan, we will require technical assistance from consultants with sound knowledge, expertise, and experience. Collective work responsibilities and coordination of all stakeholders and RBM partners is also required. Tasks of Technical oversight/Technical Assistant  The technical support/oversight should support the NMEP to: •    Conduct desk review: Review the Malaria Strategic Plan 2021 – 2025 and work plans of NMEP to ascertain the targets, goals, objectives, activities and indicators. •    Review all available reports/documents on NMEP Surveillance, M&E system including that of the SWOT analysis of the M&E system using the GF M&E system-strengthening tool, the National M&E framework for malaria control, Plan to Strengthen the National Malaria Reporting System and the National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP) etc. •    Develop an M&E matrix for the NMSP 2021 – 2025 Develop an M&E work plan: Based on the above matrix, develop a detailed M&E work plan specifying the activities, means of verification, defining responsibilities, the time frame, and budget to conduct consensus meeting. •    Build consensus on the M&E plan within the RBM partnership and elicit buy-ins/commitments of all implementers (partners, donors, other relevant programmes and stakeholders) to the M&E Plan as part of the principle of the three ‘ones’.  Methodology 1.    Entry/Briefing meetings with NMEP M&E branch to provide regular updates  to M&E subcommittee members 2.    Review strategic planning order to propose an indicator matrix that can track the implementation of the strategic plan and evaluate its set targets 3.    Support and work closely with NMEP team-based teams, the sub committees and partners /stakeholders leading to consensus Deliverables 1.    Finalized National Malaria Programme Surveillance, M&E Plan 2.    A costed Annual Operational Plan for M&E 3.    A documented report of the process Reporting arrangements  •    In carrying out the assignment, the consultant is expected to consult with and work closely with the M&E branch through the Head/ SME branch and the other key Branches of NMEP with strong reference from the NMSP 2021-2025. •    The consultant shall operate under the general supervision of the National Coordinator, National Malaria Elimination Programme through the Head, M&E branch.
