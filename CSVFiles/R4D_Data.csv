Project Background
 
 Launched in 2017, the African Collaborative for Health Financing Solutions (ACS) is a five-year, USAID-funded project that supports countries to advance toward universal health coverage (UHC) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
ACS aims to advance UHC in SSA by working with countries to identify challenges to implementation of health financing policies that support UHC. ACS supports multi-stakeholder processes and collective solutions, including developing targeted learning agendas, communications opportunities, advocacy and accountability activities that drive UHC progress.
ACS supports countries by:
 Identifying operational challenges around health financing policies.
 Bringing essential people to the table, then facilitating evidence-based collaboration and processes to design, test, and adapt solutions to tackle those challenges.
 Creating communication pathways to strengthen and support learning, advocacy and accountability.
 
 Country Context
 
 As a relatively young country that received its independence in 1990, Namibia conducted its first round of resource tracking exercises in 1993. Until 2019, the country was tracking its health-related expenditures by simultaneously using two methodologies: Systems of Health Accounts (SHA), which is more recently referred to as the National Health Accounts (NHA), and the National AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA). While NHA/SHA were mainly focusing on overall health expenditures in the country without focusing on specific diseases, the NASA methodology focuses only on expenditures relative to HIV/AIDS.
National stakeholders recognized that using these methodologies at the same time is not only time consuming but also drains the country’s financial resources. This touches on a common health systems strengthening (HSS) problem: intense pressure to bolster efficiency in health spending, but fragmented, often duplicative donor-driven (and financed) resource tracking methods that satisfy international/donor needs but do not contribute to country-owned and led strategies to understand, track, and use limited health resources. It is from that perspective the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS), in collaboration with ACS, developed an approach that ensures that the needs for both general health and HIV expenditures data can be fulfilled through one efficient and inclusive process that meets the requirements of both the SHA and NASA methodologies.
Resource Tracking Assessment
 The challenge we face now is understanding the processes that were necessary to support this transition from the dual resource tracking approach, all the way through to a harmonized resource tracking approach. The goal of this endeavor is to perform Systems Mapping, Process Tracing, and Outcome Harvesting exercises in Namibia in an attempt to demonstrate how, via the interventions of the ACS project, structures and processes of the Namibian Health System have progressed over time while focusing on the country’s HIV/AIDS resource tracking efforts.
 
Terms of Reference
 
 The data collection activities required for the Resource Tracking Assessment will take place over 6 weeks from approximately 8 February to 22 March 2021. The ACS evaluation team does not plan to travel to Namibia before or during data collection due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. All communication and activities with the ACS team will take place remotely via email, phone calls, and web conferences (e.g., Zoom) for instrument development, data collection training, piloting of the data collection instruments, data collection, and analysis.
 
The table below summarizes the estimated number of days and the relevant tasks for the data collection assistant consultant. In addition to salary costs, the detailed budget of potential providers should include ancillary costs, including communication costs for telephone calls (credits / telephone units), as all qualitative data collection will be made by phone. We expect the Data Collection Assistant to provide a summary sheet for each phone interview conducted and transcripts of the conversations and will only be reimbursed based on receipts for the costs incurred (most calls will be made by the Data Collection Lead, but in the case the Data Collection Assistant needs to reach out to a stakeholder for a clarification or additional information, this call log and transcript will help justify costs).
 
Roles and Qualifications
 
 Note: This is an opportunity only available for someone legally able to work (including consult) in Namibia. The consultant is responsible for their own work authorization in country. Consultants must also be based in Namibia. Applicants not based in Namibia will not be considered.
 
 Data Collection Assistant
 
 The role of the Data Collection Assistant is to support the Data Collection Lead during the qualitative data collection process. This includes the taking notes and making transcriptions during the key informant interviews. The Data Collection Assistant will also support the Data Collection Lead with the logistics of scheduling and implementing these interviews including managing the Zoom or other teleconferencing software during the interviews and keeping track of an interview calendar and updating as interviews are secured or re-scheduled.
 
CV must demonstrate experience with qualitative data collection, detailed notetaking and transcription, managing administrative tasks, timely execution activities that met predetermined deadlines, and between 2-3 years of experience. Understanding of various quantitative data collection techniques and the Namibian health care system a plus.

The EAL practice at R4D works with partners to devise new strategies to address problems in health, education, and nutrition, and to generate evidence as they design, test, and iterate on potential solutions. In addition, our team is increasingly expanding its scope of our work to support internal learning opportunities – including measuring what works with our own approaches and adapting. We tailor our best methods to partner needs and constraints to fuse evidence with action. And we work in partnership with internal and external stakeholders with the goal of using monitoring, evaluation, and learning approaches to inform decisions that can improve performance and accelerate impact.
Our approach is built on these five tenants:
Opportunity:
The EAL Director will lead innovative monitoring, evaluation, research and learning approaches to improve the performance of health, education, and nutrition systems. This person will be based on the EAL team but will work in close partnership with other teams and projects across R4D. The Director must have experience in designing and implementing monitoring and evaluation systems, whether at the project level or local solution level; in leading processes to review and analyze evidence to inform priorities for action; and in facilitating processes in partnership with local change agents, funders, and other partners to take a collaborative approach to monitoring and evaluation.
The Director will serve as a key leader on the team, advising on overall strategy and program design, contributing technical expertise to a broad array of projects, and leading project-specific evaluation and learning efforts. Our projects vary in approach from managing a collective impact approach to unify a wide range of partners around a common agenda, applying the principles of Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA), to supporting a national initiative in partnership with grassroot and policy actors to co-design and test solutions to a tough development challenge, or to playing an adaptive management role on a cutting-edge new model being tested and applied through R4D.
Our current portfolio largely involves direct engagements with internal and external partners. Our role as a “learning partner” can involve facilitating co-design workshops (using a range methods/approaches such as theory of change thinking, systems thinking, problem identification, etc.); designing the specific monitoring, evaluation, and research activities that would help inform decision making; conducting data analysis; and/or facilitating participatory “Learning Checks” where partners take stock of results and adapt their strategies accordingly. The Director will support this current work as well as efforts to expand future offerings from the practice.The role is preferably based in Washington, DC, but open to other locations, and will report to the Evaluation and Adaptive Learning Practice Lead. This position is contingent on receiving funding.
Responsibilities:
We are seeking an additional senior team member on the following activities:
Serve as a technical and managerial leader on a portfolio of existing work: Responsibilities will vary across the individual’s portfolio and may include directing the full scope of an engagement (leading the technical design and partner management, managing the funding, and leading the program management) and/or serving as a technical lead on a program lead by a colleague. Activities may involve serving as the MELA Director at a project/program level or working on the adaptive learning design for specific interventions within existing projects.
Undertake internally and externally facing business development and new program design work aligned with the priorities of the EAL practice and R4D: Senior leaders on the EAL team are entre- and intrapreneurs.As a program-funded team and organization, being able to identify high-impact, strategic, funded opportunities to use EAL methods and capabilities is key to our success and financial sustainability. This will involve partnering with other teams to jointly develop programs, co-creating new initiatives with donors, leading proposals in response to strategic RFPs, or developing new opportunities under R4D-led buy-in mechanisms.
Build the team: To succeed, we need a great team. EAL Directors work with each other, the EAL practice lead, and operations officer, to build a team with the right skills and talents to deliver on our work. This begins with designing roles, hiring and recruiting, and mentoring and managing others.
Share the work and influence others: Senior leaders on the team are also thought leaders, who identify opportunities to share our work and influence our field, whether through public speaking, participating in relevant communities of practice, or publishing and writing.
Qualifications:
Advanced degree, preferably in economics, public policy, public administration, systems, social sciences, health or education, or other relevant disciplines
10+ years experience in evaluation, research and/or policy design
Demonstrated interest in the use of evidence, rigorous impact measurement, and data to improve international development policies and programs

R4D seeks a highly motivated and dynamic Health Financing Program Officer to play a key role in the Global Health Practice contributing health financing expertise to USAID’s Health Financing Activity (HFA) in Indonesia.
Please note, this position will be based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Indonesian nationals are encouraged to apply. This position includes a local benefits package and does not include international relocation or expatriate benefits.
Practice:
R4D’s Global Health portfolio leverages extensive networks and expertise to improve health and achieve equity in health outcomes for all people around the world. Whether it's assessing policies that can support research and development on new drugs and vaccines, exploring innovations in healthcare and connecting innovators to each other or to investors, supporting the growing global movement for universal health coverage, or producing on-demand research and forecasting to help countries and global institutions plan their healthcare futures, R4D’s global health work unlocks new possibilities for global health actors worldwide.
Background – USAID Health Financing Activity (HFA):
Following the Government of Indonesia’s (GoI) successful launch of national health insurance in 2014, the government faces a range of options on how to continue to increase coverage, efficiency, quality, and sustainable financing. USAID’s Health Financing Activity (HFA) is a 5-year technical assistance project aimed to strengthen local capacity in financial analysis, stakeholder engagement, learning and decision making. HFA will support the Ministry of Health’s leadership and vision to improve financial protection, equitable access to quality health services, and health outcomes.
By allocating pooled funds on behalf of the population to healthcare providers, the GoI acts as a healthcare “purchaser”. More strategic purchasing of health goods and services is one approach to getting better value for money. When effectively implemented, strategic health purchasing can increase value for money by creating deliberate incentives for efficient delivery of high-quality, cost-effective services. The recent expansion of national health insurance (JKN) in Indonesia brings increased opportunities to influence provider behaviors via financial levers, including more strategic purchasing of health services. R4D’s role is to support the HFA to improve capacity for strategic health purchasing under JKN. To this end, two strategic purchasing pilots – one for TB and one for maternal health services - are proposed to better incentivize providers to produce improved quality and work towards better value for health. The initial focus of this position is to provide technical and implementation support to the MNH purchasing pilot.
To design the proposed purchasing pilot, the Center for Financing and Health Insurance (PPJK) in the Ministry of Health convened a multi-stakeholder MNH Strategic Health Purchasing Technical Working Group (TWG) in 2018.  The TWG identified service delivery challenges that could be improved through better health purchasing. These included earlier detection of risk in pregnancy, referral systems and procedures, and continuity of care during pregnancy and the post-partum period. In 2019, a technical team supporting the TWG (consisting of USAID, The World Bank, and consultants) conducted analysis, formulation, and validation of a set of strategic purchasing policy options to address these identified challenges. These options were presented to the TWG, assessed against a set of criteria, and refined into a final recommendation for a purchasing pilot to be implemented. The proposed pilot will test new ways of contracting and paying providers for maternal health services through JKN. Recently, the Family Health Directorate (Kesga) of the Ministry of Health selected two pilot districts for implementation of the pilot – Kota Serang and Kabupaten Serang in Banten Province, West Java.
Opportunity:
R4D seeks a Health Financing Program Officer to support health financing-related aspects of the Strategic Health Purchasing – Indonesia (SHP Indonesia) portfolio, with a focus on maternal and newborn health. The Officer will work under the guidance of a Senior Program Officer. The Program Officer will provide direct health financing and strategic purchasing support to the SHP Indonesia portfolio, including analytical and consultative activities in support of improving capacity for strategic health purchasing under JKN.
This includes support for qualitative and quantitative analysis, interpretation and translation of results to inform the design of the maternal health provider payment pilots for improved purchasing through JKN, technical support to the MNH Strategic Health Purchasing TWG, and ongoing coaching and capacity-building on strategic purchasing for JKN stakeholders. As part of this work, the Health Financing Program Officer will help manage existing stakeholder relationships and cultivate new partnerships that aim to communicate our impact and meet objectives.
The Health Financing Program Officer will be expected to manage existing stakeholder relationships including leaders at BPJS-K, the Ministry of Health (MOH), and IBI as well as other development partners (USAID, World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), implementing partners (Palladium, DAI, ThinkWell), and civil society as well as HFA core staff, and cultivate new partnerships that aim to communicate our impact and meet objectives.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

Background:
Indonesia’s national health insurance scheme, Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), covers more than 200 million people (>75% of the population). JKN is an important means of providing access to essential health services for the population, but the increasing cost of JKN and ongoing budget deficits jeopardize its sustainability. Deficits need to be managed by stabilizing the growth in health expenditure per member while maintaining access to necessary services and improving quality. The national health insurance agency (BPJS-K) can strengthen JKN’s financial sustainability while also improving quality and service delivery outcomes by adopting more strategic health purchasing approaches. To this end, the Government of Indonesia will implement two strategic health purchasing pilot initiatives to better incentivize providers to provide improved quality care and work towards better value for money in health. One pilot, in Serang district, will focus on maternal and newborn health (MNH) services. The second pilot, in Medan district, will focus on tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment services. The interventions will test new ways of contracting and paying providers for these services.
Funding for the pilots is provided by two USAID-sponsored projects in Indonesia (the USAID Health Financing Activity1 and the USAID Tuberculosis Private Sector Activity2).

 Project Context
To achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2025, the federal government of India launched a health system reform Ayushman Bharat–Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB–PMJAY) in 2018 combining comprehensive primary health care (PHC) (primarily through public facilities) with strategic purchasing for secondary and tertiary care. AB-PMJAY is designed as a continuum of care through the creation of 150,000 Health and Wellness Centres to provide PHC, covering both maternal and child health services and non-communicable diseases, including free essential drugs and diagnostic services. PMJAY aims to provide health protection for secondary and tertiary care to 40 percent of the country’s population - nearly 500 million people. The provision of comprehensive PHC will be provided almost exclusively through publicly run Health and Wellness Centers, while beneficiaries should be able to access covered services for secondary and tertiary care from any public or empaneled private hospital.
States are now responsible for the adaptation and implementation of the federal AB-PMJAY reform with state health authorities leading the implementation of PMJAY. States are free to continue to provide existing health insurance schemes alongside the national program or integrate them with the new scheme. States are also able to choose their own operating model. The design of the PMJAY reform and the complexity and diversity in existing state processes and structures and operational models among states poses challenges to ensuring successful implementation of PMJAY. Questions remain as to whether each of the states has the necessary institutional structure, functions, operating systems, and capacity to effectively implement AB–PMJAY and strategically purchase secondary and tertiary services from public and private providers to ensure available funds are used efficiently, promoting access to necessary care with services of good quality.
Globally, interest in sourcing local, contextualized knowledge and expertise for strategic purchasing is growing. In 2018, Results for Development (R4D) launched the Strategic Purchasing Africa Resource Center (SPARC) with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The SPARC is housed within Amref Health Africa. SPARC connects expertise (individuals and institutions) in the region with country demand to strengthen strategic purchasing and capture and share lessons learned on practical implementation approaches. The SPARC has been established as a go-to source of information, support and capacity building for strategic purchasing to get better value for heath spending to advance UHC. SPARC works through linkages and partnerships with government agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs implementing strategic approaches to expand a cadre of regional experts and elevate the visibility of dialogue around strategic purchasing. It also connects experts for peer learning, while offering coaching, mentoring and access to global resources.
Project Overview
Drawing on the experience of SPARC, R4D will assess whether a strategic purchasing resource center could add value to the domestic and international technical support currently being provided at the national and state level in India, and/or build on existing country-owned models for strategic purchasing support, to ensure states prioritize strategic health purchasing in their PMJAY implementation agendas, build adequate institutional functions and capacity to carry out strategic purchasing, and capture and share practical lessons on effective implementation. This project will assess whether such a resource center is of value and if so, how it could be implemented effectively in India including identifying potential India-based institutions to host the center.
The project objectives include:
Assessing the potential of a strategic purchasing resource center to add value to existing technical support efforts to strengthen PMJAY implementation;
Developing a value proposition and set-up plan for a Strategic Purchasing Resource Center in India;
Highlighting the value of this exercise by leaving behind at least one concrete knowledge/learning output, e.g., a synthesis of findings from a multi-state strategic purchasing functional mapping exercise.
 Opportunity
R4D is seeking an India-based senior consultant for a 6-month consultancy to help lead and coordinate R4D’s efforts to assess the potential of a strategic purchasing resource center to add value to other technical support efforts to strengthen PMJAY implementation.
Working in partnership with R4D, the consultant will: coordinate project activities in India; co-lead assessment of the value of a resource center; identify and assess potential institutions to host the eventual resource center; landscape existing capacity building efforts for strategic purchasing in India; coordinate a state-level strategic purchasing functional capacity mapping activity (using a tool developed by SPARC that will be implemented by state-level technical institutions to be identified through this project); and support synthesis of project findings.

Africa, Asia, District of Columbia, Ethiopia, Europe, North America')","Results for Development (R4D) is a leading non-profit global development partner. We collaborate with change agents around the world — government officials, civil society leaders and social innovators — to create strong systems that support healthy, educated people. We help our partners move from knowing their goal to knowing how to reach it. We combine global expertise in health, education and nutrition with analytic rigor, practical support for decision-making and implementation and access to peer problem-solving networks. Together with our partners, we build self-sustaining systems that serve everyone and deliver lasting results. Then we share what we learn so others can achieve results for development, too.
I. Background
Results for Development (R4D) through its Market Shaping work contributes to global and country level efforts towards improving continuous availability of affordable and high-quality essential health and nutrition commodities in the public health system.  We particularly leverage market shaping practices both at global and country levels by identifying critical market inefficiencies and working closely with key actors to develop and execute market solutions across the supply, demand, financing and regulatory aspects of the market at scale.
In Ethiopia, specifically R4D has been supporting the Ethiopia Pharmaceutical and Supply Agency (EPSA) in shaping the market to catalyze increased access to and appropriate use of child health commodities such as amoxicillin dispersible tablet, and most recently expanded its support to address system level market shaping capacity building needs.
Historically, EPSA has relied on donors and partners for market shaping support, which have generally taken the form of short-term, product specific and not focused on addressing broader system-level market shaping needs or on building EPSA’s market shaping capacities.   In 2018, EPSA established for the first time a Quantification and Market Shaping Directorate (QMSD) to own, design and deliver market shaping interventions which is an important milestone towards self-reliant and sustainable market shaping investment in the public health system. While EPSA had a substantial track record in quantification prior to the establishment of QMSD, market shaping is a new role for EPSA. Catalytic capacity building support that center around building ownership and sustainability is needed to help QMSD develop experience and capacity specifically in market shaping, to enable EPSA to fully play a lead “market manager” role.
A consultant is therefore needed to support R4D’s market shaping team in the design and delivery of appropriate capacity building support to QMSD and other relevant directorates within EPSA. This support will be informed with the findings from the ongoing comprehensive market shortcomings assessment, and will be provided concurrently with QMSD organizational structure optimization work, for which a separate ToR is available at  TOR - Technical assistance support to design organizational blueprint for QMSD. Interested consultants who believe they are qualified for both consultancies are encouraged to apply for both. 
II. Objectives
The overall objective of this consultancy work is to strengthen capacity within QMSD and other relevant directorates within EPSA towards owning, standardizing and continuously playing a lead market shaping role through a well-designed and properly delivered coaching support. 
III. Scope of Work
The consultant will be expected to undertake the following key activities.
IV. Reporting Line
The consultant will report directly to a member of the MSCIP senior project leadership (Country Director, Ethiopia office, or Program Director, Market Shaping Practice), and liaise directly with other members of the project team in Addis when relevant.  
V. Type and Duration of Contract
Part-time consultancy work during the period between October 1, 2020 to October 1, 2021, with possibility of extension. 
VI. Duty station
Work is anticipated to be performed remotely from the home location of the consultant, with essential travel for meetings in Addis Ababa at stages where intensive face to face discussion with EPSA and QMSD leadership is critically needed, and based on a joint assessment of the COVID-19 situation. Please note, as an organization R4D is taking a conservative approach to consultant and staff travel and is likely to be significantly more cautious than is required by any local or international rules.
VII. Qualifications of consultant
MA in business administration, supply chain / pharmaceuticals, public health, or other relevant discipline to market shaping for health commodities
Minimum 10 Years of relevant experience, to include:
Hands-on experience in health commodity market shaping and/or pharmaceuticals supply chain system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries

Strong qualitative and quantitative analytical skills as well as the ability to skillfully communicate, both verbally and in writing, with a variety of stakeholders including government officials, private sector, implementing partners, and donors.
Demonstrated experience and comfort with strategic thinking around complex qualitative and quantitative analytical methodologies while providing guidance to others’ analytical skills
Highly collaborative team player, and possess keen problem-solving skills with experience independently driving analysis.
Fluency in English language is required; knowledge of Amharic is an advantage but not required

Willingness to travel domestically and internationally depending on the COVID-19 related global and local restrictions
