This includes learning from peers about barriers that MOHs have faced, what strategies have worked or not worked to increase budget execution and enabling factors to be considered. The Activity will develop a knowledge product that documents promising practices and lessons, which all countries, including USAID priority countries, can adapt and apply to strengthen their health budget execution, and which USAID missions can use to inform their future investments.To implement the joint learning approach, R4D, will (i) design, organize and facilitate virtual joint learning (ii) support, where needed, one-to-one technical assistance to five priority countries, and (iii) support the development of a global knowledge product with participating countries. The learning exchange will be housed under the JLN Financing and Payment Models for Primary Health Care collaborative, composed of 19 countries, and led by R4D. To support the facilitation of these new learning activities, R4D will engage a country facilitator with subject matter expertise on Public Financial Management (PFM), and with extensive experience leading PFM interventions and reforms in their country.

JKN is an important means of providing access to essential health services for the population, but the increasing cost of JKN and ongoing budget deficits jeopardize its sustainability. Deficits need to be managed by stabilizing the growth in health expenditure per member while maintaining access to necessary services and improving quality. The national health insurance agency (BPJS-K) can strengthen JKN’s financial sustainability while also improving quality and service delivery outcomes by adopting more strategic health purchasing approaches. To this end, the Government of Indonesia will implement two strategic health purchasing pilot initiatives to better incentivize providers to provide improved quality care and work towards better value for money in health. One pilot, in Serang district, will focus on maternal and newborn health (MNH) services. The second pilot, in Medan district, will focus on tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment services. The interventions will test new ways of contracting and paying providers for these services.Funding for the pilots is provided by two USAID-sponsored projects in Indonesia (the USAID Health Financing Activity1 and the USAID Tuberculosis Private Sector Activity2). The two projects have been supporting the design of these pilots and will oversee their implementation, in close collaboration with the government of Indonesia. R4D is a subcontractor on both of these projects, providing technical leadership on strategic purchasing across all project objectives, and is responsible for preparing the pilot design, facilitating national and district level coordination for pilot implementation, and developing capacity building modules.1.) USAID’s Health Financing Activity (HFA), led by ThinkWell, will further USAID’s health systems strengthening agenda to support the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to sustain and increase efficiency in health financing to improve financial protection, equitable access to quality health services, and health outcomes in the priority areas of HIV, tuberculosis, and maternal and newborn health.2.) USAID’s Tuberculosis Private Sector Activity (TBPS), led by FHI360, aims to contribute to Indonesia’s national goals to reduce tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and incidence by increasing the number of private provider clients who receive quality TB services. Specifically, the goal of TBPS is to increase the number of care-seeking clients in the private sector who are correctly diagnosed, notified, and have successfully completed TB treatment",R4D

We collaborate with change agents around the world — government officials, civil society leaders and social innovators — to create strong systems that support healthy, educated people. We help our partners move from knowing their goal to knowing how to reach it. We combine global expertise in health, education and nutrition with analytic rigor, practical support for decision-making and implementation and access to peer problem-solving networks. Together with our partners, we build self-sustaining systems that serve everyone and deliver lasting results. Then we share what we learn so others can achieve results for development, too. We have a unique and vibrant culture at R4D. Diversity, equity and inclusion are at the heart of our work environment and help advance our mission. Diversity—of ideas, identities, perspectives and backgrounds—is vital to who we are and what we do. We seek people who embrace these values and will help reinforce them. Our work culture is collaborative, creative and entrepreneurial. We operate based on trust and respect. Teams across the organization frequently collaborate on programmatic work and support each other in continuously building a better R4D",R4D
