About UNICEF
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
 
BACKGROUND
Following a Child Protection (CP) HQ Section Retreat held in December 2017, a commitment was made to foster staff well-being and development, including identifying ways to work together more effectively. This was followed by a mini retreat in January 2019. These efforts drew on recommendations from the 2018  local Staff Survey calling for improved work/life balance, transparency on how management decisions are made, and preventing burnout.
The pertinence of these discussions in the CP HQ section was further underscored by the Independent Task Force report on Workplace Gender- Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Harassment and Abuse of Authority released in May 2019 which found that “…despite good intentions, UNICEF is not living [the organization’s core values of care, respect, integrity, trust and accountability] when it comes to this most important resource”, i.e. its staff.
In a series of subsequent discussions in CP HQ, dubbed “Elephants in the Room”, the section reviewed and reiterated its commitment to ensuring a work environment that is free of harassment and abuse, encourages mutual respect and collegial attitude, and appreciates diversity and respect of cross-cultural differences. Staff felt that there had been uneven progress in the areas identified in the discussions. As such, the majority of staff agreed that a section “charter” (or “Golden Rules”) should be developed which could define collective ground rules for how staff work in the section work together.
The follow up “Charter / Golden Rules” discussion had been scheduled for early March but was put on hold with the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, which instituted ‘Work from Home’ arrangements precluding face-to-face discussions and ushered in a period of intense programmatic response to the pandemic. Early on, it was thought these discussions could be revisited when the pandemic subsided and staff returned to work. However, external events superseded this thinking. The killing of George Lloyd by police officers in the U.S. in May 2020 sparked massive protests domestically and globally, calling for an end to racial injustice and inequality of opportunities. With #BlackLivesMatter becoming one of, if not the largest activist movement in U.S. history, questions about racism and racial discrimination and injustice generated discussions worldwide, including at UNICEF in and out of the workplace.
Responding to this moment and the movement, a dedicated section meeting was held in early June titled “Let's talk about Race from a Black Lives Matter perspective” facilitated by an external consultant. CP HQ Staff were invited to a dialogue around racial and ethnic identity and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and injustice in different settings. A key outcome of the meeting was the call for additional opportunities to further reflect on these issues as well as gender and diversity in the workplace.
Terms of Reference / Deliverables
In close collaboration and working with the Child Protection Senior Adviser, the incumbent will be responsible for:
1.         Preparing and facilitating a series of discussion/s related to intersectionality  and broadening the lens of inclusion in CP HQ to support reflection on gender, racial discrimination, diversity and power, and intersectionality more broadly, including how multiple dimensions of a person’s identity such as ethnicity and race*, gender, class, sexuality, and disability shape people’s experiences in the workplace.
a.         Developing a plan to hold facilitated discussions with CP HQ. This plan should clearly propose the methodology (how, who and why). The plan should include clear strategies to enable people who may be unwilling to share/participate publicly can still have their say and should also provide a confidential way of requesting and providing feedback.
b.         The facilitated discussion/s will involve the identification of ineffective/discriminatory dynamics that may exists or be perceived to exist among section colleagues in a confidential, tactful and respectful manner with the objective of translating those into concrete and actionable “golden rules”. 
2.         Preparing a final report documenting the facilitated discussion/s which should include results of the discussion, including issues that can be incorporated into the “golden rules”, and any agreed next steps and person(s) responsible. The report should be in English and no longer than longer 10 pages in total.
Due to the current limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the assignment will be home-based with no travel.

BACKGROUND
Preventive public health and nutrition programs, such as immunization, screening for acute malnutrition and micronutrient supplementation are a key component of a successful health system. Preventive interventions, such as vaccines, deworming, micronutrient supplements etc. are generally highly cost-effective and deliver extensive benefits to society in terms of averted mortality and morbidity. Although almost all preventive programs are delivered community-wide, they use a variety of different delivery strategies, including campaigns, targeted outreach and routine service delivery. Effectiveness of delivery is sometimes equated with coverage and equity in distribution, but an encompassing definition could plausibly include additional attributes, such as sustainability, resilience, responsiveness and efficiency (e.g. cost-effectiveness). A key limitation is our understanding of what makes for ‘effective delivery’, as well as how decision-makers perceive of and use the concept of delivery effectiveness.
Focusing on vitamin A supplementation (VAS), UNICEF is conducting analysis of the effectiveness of delivery strategies for preventive nutrition and health services. VAS is one of the world’s largest public health programs that reaches approximately 250 million children every year in countries that are at increased risk of vitamin A deficiency. Supplementing children aged 6 to 59 months with a high dose of vitamin A is a highly effective public health intervention in deficient populations that saves millions of lives. Because supplementation does not address underlying causes of deficiency, it must be repeated every four to six months – or until dietary intake of vitamin A is sufficient. Despite the potential benefits of VAS, data for 2018 suggest less than two-thirds of children in at-risk countries receive the recommended doses of vitamin A. Most doses of the supplement are delivered through campaigns, but these take various forms, including integrated child health days and co-delivery with oral polio vaccines in house-to-house campaigns. Increasingly, vitamin A is being delivered during ongoing, routine health system contacts.

Background & Rationale
Brazil has made steady progress in all education-related indicators regarding access, permanence and quality of learning. In terms of access, from 1990 to 2013 the percentage of children of compulsory school age who were out of school was reduced by 64%, from 19.6% to 6.4%. Even though this percentage seems small, it was equivalent to 2.8 million children and adolescents in 2015 according to the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD 2015). In general, they are poor, Afro-descendants, indigenous and/or live in traditional communities: most of them live on the outskirts of large urban centers, in the Semi-Arid, in the Amazon and in rural areas. Children and adolescents with disabilities face very severe exclusions: in 2015, almost 30% of all children with disabilities were out of school.
Quality is one of the remaining challenges to universal access to and permanence in school and it is a national priority as stated in the SDG 4 (SDG). In 2018, close to 6.5 million children and adolescents in primary and secondary education were 2 or more years behind their grades, one of the main causes for drop out. Other elements include discrimination, child labor, and pregnancy, inadequate curricula, including in relation to racial and inclusive relations, and undervalued teachers. Poor infrastructure also limits opportunities: for example, only 32% of all schools in Brazil have sports facilities, and only 24% have adequate facilities for people with disabilities. The access to primary education is well balance among boys and girls, but for secondary education, especially in rural areas, the girls are more likely to do not access and drop out more than boys. The access to basic WASH at school level remain a challenge in the intervention areas.
In 2017, just the 23,9% of public schools all over the country achieved or surpassed the established learning goal (based on IDEB). The Amazon and the Semiarid regions present a more challenging situation. In the Amazon state, 66% of the children that concludes the first stage of elementary school, have basic or insufficient levels in Math and only 31% of those who concludes the second stage have enough levels in Portuguese. In the state of Bahia, part of the Semiarid region, 60% of the students that concludes the first stage of elementary school have insufficient levels of learning in Portuguese and only 8% of those who concludes the second stage are proficient in Math.
UNICEF in Brazil has as one of the priorities of its Country Program for 2017-2021, the confrontation of this culture of school failure in Brazil. To this end, the Education area has developed the Selo UNICEF Município Aprovado (UNICEF Seal of Approved Municipality). The Seal supports and encourages governments to positively commit to and guarantee the rights of children and adolescents in the Semiarid and Brazilian Legal Amazon, with the aim of reducing the inequalities of these regions in relation to the rest of the country.
When participating in the UNICEF Seal, the municipality must follow the proposed methodology to strengthen the skills of local actors so that they can work in an intersectoral and integrated manner and offer quality public policies, in addition to monitoring social indicators and assessing performance and social participation. The involvement and participation of the Rights Council, Tutelary Council and sector councils is also a fundamental part of the social participation process. They must also implement social mobilization actions that guarantee the participation of adolescents. The municipalities that make the most progress in guaranteeing the rights of children and adolescents are recognized with the UNICEF Seal, and can make use of this recognition during the next cycle of the programme.
In connection to UNICEF Seal, the Successful School Paths strategy aims to support municipalities and states in the diagnostic, definition, implementation and evaluation of specific curriculum for students that are late in school. To achieve the results, the strategy foresees the integration of schools and other territorial actors (including NGOs and health and social protection sectors) and the participation of the targeted students in the planning and development of the activities.
It is important to understand that age-grade distortion is not a problem unique to one school, but part of a broader reality brought by a school system that often reproduces it. From this perspective, it is necessary to understand that age-grade distortion is a complex issue, the solution of which is the constitution of a protection and attention network for children and adolescents. The solution also includes a support network for school management teams and teachers who set themselves the challenge of facing school failure and promoting successful paths for these children and adolescents.
Another initiative which adds to UNICEF Seal is the Fora da Escola Não Pode! which confronts school drop-out through an Active School Search strategy. This initiative is developed in multiple fronts of action and seeks to raise awareness among different actors responsible for school inclusion, as well as society in general, about the problem of school exclusion and viable practical plans to mitigate this problem.
Finally, the recent and ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a UNICEF's response in Brazil aiming to contribute to the prevention, early detection and control of the coronavirus in the country; and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on the lives of girls and boys.
On the education front, the emergency response has a strong focus on public policy. UNICEF is working with governments at the federal, state and municipal levels, businesses and civil society to mitigate the impact of the crisis and ensure continuity of services adapted to the new reality. In addition, UNICEF invests in supporting adolescents' mental health and engaging them in actions and also in monitoring the situation and social impact to produce evidence in support of policies and actions.
This consultancy will support the implementation of activities from these strategies (UNICEF Seal, Successful School Path and Active School Search) and education emergency response to Covid-19 to help the most excluded boys and girls to benefit from enhanced and inclusive public policies and services as well as activities that help the most vulnerable boys and girls benefit from quality social policies for vulnerable children and adolescents. The individual contractor will actively participate in decision making processes, contributing to the achievements of the Education Area in the programme.
 
Purpose
The individual contractor seeks to address our current needs to help the development and implementation of Education Area activities to both Outcome 1: Enhanced policies for excluded children and adolescents in education area and Outcome 2: Quality social policies for vulnerable children and adolescents, in line with Components 1 and 2 of the Brazil Country Programme 2017-2021.

Background and Justification
The population of Botswana is characterized by a sizeable proportion of adolescents and young people. It is estimated that adolescents (10-19 years) represent 20.6 percent (418,247) and young people (20-24 years) represent 10 percent (200,315) of the total population. This 10-24 age cohort is one of the most vulnerable groups for HIV infection and AIDS related deaths. The last two Botswana AIDS Indicator Surveys (BAIS 2008 and 2013), as well as the 2016 Botswana Youth Behavioral and Biological Surveillance Survey among students ages 13 to19 years, suggest worrying and negative trends in behavior among adolescents and young people (AYP). HIV prevalence among young people (15-24 years) continues to remain high, with significant gender disparity (9.3 % among females and 5.0 % males).
Botswana is committed to ending AIDS among adolescents and young people. This is evidenced by the country’s policy direction with AYP prioritized in the Third Botswana National Strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS 2019-2023 (NSF3).  The Government with support from UNICEF and partners has also developed a five year (2019-2023) National HIV and AIDS Programming Framework for Adolescents and Young People (AYP) that is guiding and informing an effective HIV response to prevent new HIV infections and reduce AIDS-related deaths. Despite these efforts, each week approximately 60 AYP are newly infected with HIV, with majority of infections (70%) amongst adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Consequently, NSF3 has further identified HIV prevention as a priority area of focus, with the government committed to achieving the goals of the five prevention pillars - combination prevention for AGYW and their partners; combination prevention for key populations; comprehensive condom programming; voluntary male medical circumcision and sexual and reproductive health services for men and boys; and rapid introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). All of these key pillars are underpinned by a focus on evidence, community and human rights, equity and inclusion.
While young people are disproportionately vulnerable and affected by HIV, spaces for their meaningful participation and engagement in decision making, policy development and programming in HIV, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), as well as other areas of concern to them are limited.  Consultations with AYP in Botswana have further established that youth participation is minimal or non-existent in national development processes, including in planning and delivery of HIV and health programmes. Adolescents and young people’s knowledge about their own lives, their creativity, skills and aspirations, can be harnessed to inform the development and monitoring of more effective, relevant and sustainable policies, programmes and services. As such the need to strengthen the engagement and involvement of AYP in policy design and programme delivery has been identified, particularly the establishment of a platform that elevates and amplifies the voices, ideas and creativity of AYP.
As such, the National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA) is planning to establish a forum that will provide AYP the space to be meaningfully involved in decision-making, policy development and programming in HIV, SRH and other areas of concern to them. The envisioned forum would allow AYP to vigorously review and interrogate existing policies, programmes and interventions, as well as examine their relevance in addressing the needs of AYP in Botswana. It will provide a platform and space for AYP to freely dialogue and engage outside of formal settings. It will also facilitate AYP to be leaders and advocates of change and build the awareness, skills and capacities of AYP to actively and effectively participate in policy making processes and programming. The vision is to have a national forum, with equitable representation from the diverse groups of AYP and with corresponding structures established at the district level.
It is against this background that UNICEF is seeking the services of a local consultant to support NAHPA with the establishment of a National Youth Forum. The consultant will work together with a youth task force and will facilitate the entire process of establishing the youth forum from mapping of existing youth structures and networks at the national and sub-national level to development and dissemination of the national youth forum strategic framework, two-year implementation plan, monitoring and evaluation template and reporting tools.

BACKGROUND 
Malawi has been hit with consecutive and successive climatic shocks over the last few years. With a low capacity to cope, and little time to recover, the country has witnessed escalating food and nutrition insecurity. In this context, humanitarian food response, most commonly referred to as ‘MVAC’ , has increased considerably, reaching 6.7 million people across 24 of the 28 districts between July 2016 and March 2017. This was the largest and longest response in the country’s history. In 2017, 1,043,000 people in 20 districts have been identified as phase 3 food insecure. 
With pre-existing high and chronic levels of food and income insecurity, any shock further negatively impacts the most vulnerable populations. Poor people are among the groups most exposed to and suffering the most from shocks, including drought or floods: Limited livelihood options, resources, and access to services, mean that these households are the least able to withstand shocks, especially without resorting to negative coping mechanisms. Major negative events, particularly rainfall and loss of off-farm employment, contribute to the poor households remaining in their status, and also increase the likelihood of non-poor households falling into poverty.
Social Protection Programmes are currently unable to predictably meet chronic needs and systems are not prepared to effectively expand or facilitate humanitarian interventions in times of crisis. To date, important investments have been made in the social protection sector, but coverage has remained limited, and the system has suffered from insufficient integration in programme design and consistency of programmes’ objectives. 
Humanitarian action has in practice been filling the gap by responding to chronic needs which ought to be addressed by social protection systems. In turn, the social protection system hasn’t been leveraged to implement a more cost effective humanitarian response thereby leading to a suboptimal response, drawing on humanitarian budgets, technical expertise, and stretching the positioning of humanitarian actors as non-government stakeholders. The underlying vulnerabilities of Malawi, including chronic levels of food insecurity and high exposure to climate risks, “are an important factor in producing recurrent humanitarian emergencies”. As such, predictable seasonal patterns, and even minor weather variations currently result in humanitarian crisis. 
To tackle this issue, efforts have been made by the Government of Malawi, in line with global commitments , to expand the current coverage of the social protection system and better align humanitarian action and social protection. Through the Malawi National Social Support Programme II, the government has made a strong commitment to design and implement a social protection system that: covers more people, provides complementary support to respond to the multiple and compounding needs of the population, and that is sensitive to shocks, i.e. that contributes to mitigate, respond to and recover from shocks, in collaboration with the humanitarian sector. This notably includes the ability of key social protection programmes to temporarily scale up to expand in response to a shock when needs of the population are exceeded and scale back down. 
JUSTIFICATION
Shock-sensitive social protection is a topic that has attracted a lot of interest from different actors, within and external to Government, including from Development Partners, Donors, NGOs and Government Ministries. 
Different actors have brought in, and partially operationalized, different approaches towards SSSP that fail to follow a joint understanding in Malawi, despite broad guidance in MNSSP II. 
Shock-sensitive social protection is a relatively young concept within UNICEF which requires better communication to fulfil its full potential in linking social protection with humanitarian interventions. 
How can you make a difference?
The successful candidate will be expected to carry out the following key objectives: 


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF and WFP staff, develop a story-board for a 3-4 minute documentary video, explaining why SSSP is important in the Malawi context, and showcasing the positive effect of Shock-Sensitive Social Protection in Malawi;


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF and WFP staff, develop a story-board for a 2-3 minutes animated video explaining briefly what Shock-Sensitive Social Protection (SSSP) is and as an example, how the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Programme already expands vertically in response to shocks, and has the potential to further expand coverage and services in the future, if systems allow;


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF and WFP staff, write copy and conceptualize an infograph that explains SSSP as a concept in general, including the type of infograph, introduction text (<100 words), headlines and subheadings;


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF and WFP staff, write copy and conceptualize an infograph that explains SSSP as a concept in the Malawi specific context, including the type of infograph, introduction text (<100 words), headlines and subheadings;


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF and WFP staff, write copy and conceptualize an infograph that explains how the SCTP has scaled up vertically, and can increase coverage and services, including the type of infograph, introduction text (<100 words), headlines and subheadings;


Based on the content for the above infograph (SSSP as a concept in Malawi), write copy and conceptualize an infograph that explains the SDG grant, DFID, and Irish Aid contributions to advancing SSSP in Malawi conceptually, showcasing effective contribution coordination; 


Based on technical documents and key informant interviews with UNICEF staff, write a two-pager on UNICEFs position and contribution towards SSSP in Malawi

About UNICEF
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
 
BACKGROUND
Deficiencies in essential health and social services including immunization during the response to COVID-19 have caused and will continue to result in increased indirect morbidity and mortality. Even robust health systems have been rapidly overwhelmed and compromised by a COVID-19 outbreak. There is urgent demand from countries for technical support in planning, implementing and evaluating health services during the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery phases.
WHO in collaboration with UNICEF has prepared an Operational guidance for maintaining essential health services (EHS) during an outbreak as well as Framework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19, which provides a set of targeted actions that countries should consider at national, regional, and local level to reorganize and maintain access to quality, essential health services for all. To further support countries in this area, there is need to develop a learning architecture for national and sub-national service planners, managers and providers to enable (1) maintenance of essential health services during the outbreak (2) immunization service recovery in the post-acute phase (3) sustained transformation/strengthening of immunization services in the post-pandemic phase.
The learning initiative will emphasize collection of lessons from countries to inform action within and beyond the health sector; identify and scale-up effective interventions; promote informed-action at various levels of the immunization system and facilitate sharing of experiences between countries. The learning architecture will focus on actions being taken forward by countries to maintain essential health including immunization services during the outbreak, early recovery and sustained transformation in the post-pandemic phase.
Provision and re-imagining of immunization services including campaigns during pandemic is a new strategic area for UNICEF and most of the countries are also still in the learning phase on this topic. More than 56 VPD campaigns has been postponed and only few countries have initiated vaccination campaigns. There is therefore a need for guidance and experience sharing, to support the work of governments and country offices as they increasingly work in this domain.
HQ is seeking a consultant to provide technical support to the Immunization section at HQ to document good practices, success stories and lessons learnt on re-initiating immunization services in response to COVID-19 and to support countries to effectively respond to the threat of COVID-19. The objective is to create a series of short case studies and associated stories, which will be used in technical meetings internally and externally.
 
Terms of Reference / Deliverables
The consultant will work with the Health Specialist, Accelerated Immunization Initiatives (AII), NYHQ Immunization unit on ongoing immunization in emergencies stream of work during COVID19 pandemic and consolidation of programmatic results related Measles and Rubella and other AII workstream priorities. Consultant will:
1)         Develop protocol for key informant interviews and a template structure for the case studies document (10 days)
2)         Based on key informant interviews and document review, i) develop case studies of maximum 3,000 to 4,000 words (total 5-7 country specific case studies) as agreed; ii) develop 2 or 3 Human interest stories (1,000 words max each).
3)         Review and copy-edit related resources and or reports produced by AII unit.
A case study will present a systematic review on a topic to capture knowledge and will be based on evidence, and will be used for technical guidance and advocacy, as part of UNICEF strategy to South-south contribution (SSC) through improved guidance to staff, and the fostering of learning and understanding of good practices in implementation of immunization activities/interventions during COVID19.
Case studies from the countries (TBC: Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Nepal or Pakistan, Myanmar, one country from LACRO) will be meant for in-country, regional and global immunization technical partners as well as cross-sectoral and resource mobilization partners, and senior management.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.

For every child, Hope
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.
Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires that we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene at every level. In the case of Syria, this will entail over the short term, continuing with the provision of life-saving WASH interventions and preventing the further deterioration of water and sanitation services while promoting the resilience of communities.

UNICEF promotes the rights and well-being of all children and adolescents in everything we do. Together with our allies, we work in 190 countries and territories to transform this commitment into practical actions that benefit all children, especially focusing our efforts on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded in the world. The UNICEF Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean is based in Panama and operates in 36 territories, including 24 country offices. UNICEF works to put the rights and well-being of the most disadvantaged children at the center of the social, political and economic agenda, in line with our approach to equity, working across our organization and with our partners in government, civil society and the private sector to support changes in public policies, promote social participation and increase investment for children. According to IWGIA data, in Latin America there are more than 45 million people who belong to more than 800 indigenous peoples, of which half have less than 3,000 people. And 1 in 3 inhabitants in the region is of African descent. The health crisis begins to hit indigenous and Afro-descendant populations. In most countries, they live in areas where there is little or poor health coverage. Anne Nuorgan, Chair of the Permanent Forum of Indigenous Nations on Indigenous Issues has noted: “Indigenous peoples experience a high degree of socioeconomic marginalization and are disproportionately at risk in public health emergencies, becoming even more vulnerable during this global pandemic, due to factors such as their lack of access to effective surveillance and early warning systems and adequate health and social services.” Furthermore, the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has warned of ""the situation of special vulnerability in which indigenous peoples find themselves, particularly those in voluntary isolation and initial contact, and highlights the need to develop specific responses for this group , that are respectful of their worldview and cultural diversity.”
The data on the prevalence of Covid-19 is still scattered, but as the first regional report of FILAC and FIAY points out, together with the Regional Observatory on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the number of affected communities is growing, and the number of affected and deceased grows health services and drinking water, the forced displacement of our territories, the degradation of natural resources due to extractive industries, energy projects and the consequences of climate change, which affect indigenous peoples in general”. Faced with this situation, the LACRO education section has formed a regional team of education specialists from the country offices to analyze the situation of children and adolescents of indigenous and Afrodescendant populations and their access to education in times of COVID-19 , with the aim of identifying the critical and common challenges facing bilingual intercultural education (EIB). Most countries have opted for various forms of distance education, using the Internet, TV or radio. However, it is precisely indigenous and Afro-descendant populations, the majority in rural areas, that have the most difficulties in accessing education, either because there is no coverage or because they do not have electricity permanently, the Internet, or the instruments to follow learning sessions. Although there are some countries that are offering this distance education in native languages, in most of them the offer is only in the predominant language (Spanish, Portuguese) or there is not enough cultural belonging to the content studied. In Peru, for example, of the 47 indigenous languages, only distance education programs are being offered in 9 languages, those with the largest number of speakers. Likewise, in the context of distance education, deficiencies in digital skills of both indigenous girls and boys and the teachers who serve these groups have been manifested. Thus, it is highly probable that many indigenous boys and girls who are not receiving educational services drop out of school and never return, given the situation of poverty and informality of their families' work. 
Under the joint GPE project (UNICEF, UNESCO and World Bank), UNICEF is leading on the component to reach the most vulnerable. Within the component on remote learning strategies to reach most marginalized children, the LAC region will specifically work on developing public goods for ethnic and linguistic minorities by mapping and creating a repository of learning resources and materials followed by a roll-out in selected countries. This will contribute to addressing some of the education needs of indigenous populations in the context of Covid-19.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, education...
Education Cannot Wait (ECW), established in 2016 and hosted within UNICEF, is the worlds first global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. The fund aims to inspire stronger political will to focus and invest in education in emergencies, catalyse new sources of funding and facilitate collaboration and coordination between humanitarian and development actors to increase the effectiveness of education programming in emergencies for crises-affected children. ECW disburses grants to various development and humanitarian actors (ECW grantees) who in turn deliver humanitarian assistance on the field.
The increasing breadth and complexity of ECW-funded programs calls for strengthening of the information management systems and processes in use at the ECW Secretariat. ECW recognizes the need for an integrated, centralized, simple-to-use, cloud-based information management system, whereby data seamlessly flows from ECW grantees to the ECW Secretariat, and the ECW Secretariat can validate the submitted data and integrated with additional information, as needed. This is fundamental for the ECW Secretariat to conduct analyses and produce reports.
ECW provides grants through three funding windows: First Emergency Response (FER), Acceleration Facility (AF), and Multi-Year Resilience Programs (MYRP). Each funding window requires different information (on results, on expenditures, etc.) to be submitted by grantees, as specified in annex. For this reason, a phased piloting of the information management system will be required, suggested to begin first with the FER grants, and then the MYRP and AF grants, as explained below.
The following needs were identified by ECW staff while collecting data necessary to report on the ECW results framework:

ECW needs to establish a comprehensive database that stores all grant-related information. Given ECW's ambition to the highest standards, it cannot rely on a mix of automated and manual data entry to a set of auxiliary databases (mostly in Excel) created by each section and stored in the respective cloud-based drives, resulting in high risk of human errors and creation of â€œsiloedâ€ processes.
There is a need for an online central filing location for all information and reports received from grantees. Without it, staff may utilize multiple IT solutions, which creates challenges in information management.
There needs to be a dedicated grants management software for use in ECW.
There is a need to streamline the submission of applications for funding and budget reports, as they are currently submitted in stand-alone files in Word and Excel respectively, which creates challenges in information management.
ECW needs to be able to automate the calculation of certain performance indicators for the ECW dashboard and the ECW Annual Results Report. Automating certain data checks and procedures would reduce the risk of errors and facilitate the use of real-time data, amongst other efficiency gains.

Objectives of the assignment
ECW is seeking the services of qualified individual consultant to submit proposals to create an appropriate data and information management system that:
1) Supports grantees in the submission of their program proposals via standardized online forms.
2) Supports grantees in the submission of their results and financial reports via standardized online forms.
3) Monitors ECW's progress against its results framework (latter is enclosed in annex).
4) Provides a shared database whereby a) all relevant results information on ECW systemic as well as grantees' results and expenditure can be regularly updated, stored, displayed, retrieved and shared; b) all grants-related information can be stored, updated, retrieved and viewed as a report or dashboard.
5) Generates automated reports based on selected variables (type of investment, grantee, program, geographical location, gender/age-group, population groups etc.) as requested.
6) Allows ECW, grantees and donors to view, edit and download the above-mentioned data and reports.
The objective of the procurement is to implement a data and information management system ('system' in short henceforth) with the following features:

Grantees must be able to build application forms for funding via online standardized application forms, so that benchmarks for reporting (e.g. indicator targets) and applicants' data can be stored in an online database and queried / referenced by partners and ECW Secretariat staff.
Grantees must be able to report their results and expenditures in standardized online forms, so that data on results can be stored in an online database and queried / verified / validated by partners and ECW Secretariat staff.
Users must be able to create reports, dashboards and charts based on the information contained in the database. An intuitive interface to build queries must be developed so that reports can be created in easy fashion by users who may not be IT-savvy.
The system must be able to handle both quantitative data on results (e.g. children reached, schools rebuilt, etc.), qualitative info describing results (e.g. a text summary on whether children in district x accessed education) and financial information (e.g. on expenditure or sub-granting on behalf of grantees).
The system will feature different degrees of access/privileges (can view, can edit, etc.) based on functions and roles: ECW grantees, ECW staff, etc.
The system will send notifications to assigned ECW staff members when errors, missing data or inconsistencies are found, or data validation, or approval of specific requests is needed.
The system will send notifications to assigned ECW staff members regarding deadlines (e.g. when reports are due, or when applications have been submitted)
Logical checks and data consistency checks are embedded in the system to account for potential errors in data entry.
The system must conform to standards of safety and data protection.
Data should be safely backed up and mechanisms should be put in place to prevent data loss.

 
Expected results: (measurable results)
 
Scope and timelines of the assignment
The primary objective of the assignment is to set up a system to strategically collect information coming from the field in systematized fashion, with the objective to (i) minimize the submission of unstructured, non-coded information that will require ''human'' data handling; (ii) swiftly produce reports and (iii) calculate standard indicators. Therefore, the software solution should remain lean and be developed primarily for data management and reporting purposes; under this tender ECW is not looking for ''program management'' software, or software that simply stores information.
Data should be available for analysis and consolidation at different levels:
1) at grant level, following each grant's results framework, which is contained in each approved proposal;
2) at country level -  e.g. if ECW disburses 8 grants in Mozambique, aggregated stats for Mozambique should be available;
3) at global level, following the ECW Results Framework available in Annex I;
4) by grantee organization - e.g. if ECW disburses twelve grants to a given international NGO across six countries, aggregated stats for that international NGO should be available.
It is of paramount importance to build flexibility into the system. Since grants results framework and the ECW Results Framework can change over time, the system must retain the flexibility to allow ECW staff to calculate new indicators easily; likewise, if data requirements change, ECW should be able to flexibly edit the online forms for data collection without compromising the structure and performance of the system.
The system should not rely on novel applications or require the installation of dedicated software. It must be designed for use and accessibility in humanitarian emergencies, where internet connection may not be strong and NGO personnel may not be IT-savvy.Â 
The system could be built on multiple modules:

An application module, with a standard online form collecting key information and data on each approved program proposal (envisioned outcomes, targets, budgets, etc)
A grant-level data module, collecting all quantitative data (e.g. indicators from the grants' results framework) and qualitative data (e.g. qualitative description of a certain result) for a given grant.
A ''corporate results'' module to provide the information to report against the corporate (or ''global'') ECW results framework.
A financial data module, following the templates in use by ECW for financial reporting, to collect and manage financial information.
A module with a template for submission of human-interest stories and photos from the field.

The system will be property of ECW; the data handled by the system belongs to ECW and cannot be used by third parties or the company/consultant; in no way data can be held or distributed by the contractor during or after the completion of the assignment.
The construction of the system must follow a precise timeline to ensure finalization by February 19th, 2021. The milestones of the assignment are as follows:
1) Concept note (by November 12th, 2020). The concept note should contain:

Detailed description of the structure of the envisioned system, following consultation with the ECW Secretariat;
Proposed ways of collecting and managing information, given ECW data requirements;
Modalities for aggregation and calculation of key performance indicators;
Modalities for automated approvals and notifications;
Modalities for accessing, editing, and querying the database, outlining the required privileges of different type of users;
Envisioned safety and data protection measures.

2) First iteration of the system - prototype (by November 30th, 2020). The system should be piloted to cover all ECW active grants under the FER window and all MYRPs launched in 2018 and 2019.
3) Final iteration (by January 31st, 2021). Following an AGILE methodology, and the feedback from the previous iteration, the system should take its final shape and links for uploading the necessary information be shared with all ECW Grantees.
4) Produce an online tutorial and a training manual, by February 19th, 2021.
5) Conduct a training session for New York and Geneva offices, by February 28th, 2021.
6) Provide troubleshooting for up to 6 months after launch, as needed.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
Purpose
The Spotlight Initiative is a joint UN-EU initiative to end violence against women and girls (VAWG).
UNICEF has implemented the programmes with other UN partner agencies in 11 countries in Africa and Latin America since 2019. The country programmes are implemented over the span of two phases: phase 1 between 2019 and 2020 and phase 2 between 2021 and 2022. As countries complete nearly two years of implementation, there is need for consolidation of learning and emerging results.
As a complementary exercise to the mid-term review for the entire Initiative across agencies, UNICEF plans to gather emerging results, assess progress and lessons learned at the activity level across its country offices. The documentation exercise ultimately aims to improve the effectiveness of the existing programme implementation, to advocate for more global effort to tackle VAWG and to contribute to the growing evidence body on VAWG.  The primary focus areas are for the documentation will be on activities undertaken to Pillars 3 and 4 of the Theory of Change, relating to prevention of violence and provision of essential services to women and girls’ survivors, areas where UNICEF has invested most resources.
The documentation of impacts, progress and lessons learned from UNICEF’s activities on prevention and service is undertaken in the following phases.
1)         Design phase (Q3 2020): The first phase will focus on selecting countries and specific activities for the documentation process. This phase will include defining what count as “results” and “progress” in consultation with country and regional offices. Standards in measurement methodologies will be established. Given there are three regions (West and Central Africa, East and Southern Africa and Latin America) and two pillars to cover, this exercise will investigate six activities.
2)         Documentation Phase (Q4 2020  and Q1 2021): The on-site measurement will be conducted in coordination with country and regional offices.
3)         Report-writing phase (Q2 2021): The collected evidence, lessons learned, and stories will be compiled as the mid-term review of UNICEF’s engagement in the Spotlight Initiative.

UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
UNICEF’s overall objective in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is to contribute to the realization of children’s rights to survival, growth and development through support to programmes that increase equitable and sustainable use of safe and sustainable drinking water, basic and safely managed sanitation, and promote improved hygiene. Strong internal capacity within WASH teams is essential.  –

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, results
Since 2016, UNICEF is responding to the unique needs of adolescents and young people who are seeking asylum in Europe, on the move, stranded or pushed back. The operation established in Italy aims to provides support to the Government of Italy on children and young migrants and refugees, to ensure timely, equal and appropriate care, protection and support for social inclusion, as part of the Regional Migrant and Refugee Response. Initially the Italy Response focused mainly on child protection and adolescent development, while since 2019 a Gender-Based Violence component has been integrated.
The Youth & Adolescent Development programme focuses on participation and skills building activities to guarantee Unaccompanied Minors (UAMs) and young migrants and refugees have access to key information, have their voices heard and are empowered to take the lead and have the skills and competencies needed for their social inclusion in Italy.
The focus of the Child Protection and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) programmes is access to key life protecting information, promotion of uptake of services, identification and referral of at-risk boys and girls to relevant services, including psychosocial assistance, GBV services and access to alternative care and guardianship. Moreover, in 2020 a key partnership with DG Health was established, which includes a strong component of health literacy promotion among migrant and refugees. Key health messages are therefore woven into existing programmes, with a strong focus on mental health, immunization and adolescent reproductive health.
The primary channel through which the 3 programmes (Youth & Adolescent Development, the Child Protection and GBV) combine their efforts and collaboration is U-Report on the Move (https://onthemove.ureport.in/ ), a digital platform dedicated to UAMs and young migrants and refugees living in Italy. Through the platform, U-Reporters have the possibility to voice their opinion on key issues of concern through monthly opinion polls, to access key information for their protection and social inclusion (via digital content and live chats) and to benefit from digital one-to-one counseling (legal and more) via U Partner.
Offline, mobile teams are a key channel for both the Child Protection and GBV programmes, targeting primarily young migrants and refugees who are outside of the formal reception system as well as families living in informal settlements. Outreach activities also take place within the reception system.
In support to the UNICEF Uprooted campaign, and particularly starting in 2019 with version 2.0 of Uprooted, the migrant and refugee response has stepped up efforts in support to the promotion of positive narrative around uprooted children and young people. For this purpose, other channels have been set up and/or leveraged, namely, UNICEF Italy Activate Talks (https://www.activatetalksitalia.com/ )and the U-blogger platform (https://www.ublogger.org/), as well as mass media and social media platforms targeting the Italian audience for amplification purposes.
A key component of all Communication for Development interventions has been the involvement of adolescents and young people themselves. Whilst the focus has been on UAMs and young migrants and refugees it has also included, particularly for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) activities in support to the Uprooted campaign, Italian adolescents and youth. Italian adolescents and youth engaged include young people from marginalized communities, 2nd generation migrants. To date, substantive results have been achieved with regards to youth engagement and advocacy, further work is needed to ensure that connecting young migrants and refugee voices with policy and decision makers translates into policy change.
With the onset of the COVID-19 emergency, the scope of SBCC interventions has expanded to include Risk Communication and Community engagement interventions, using both online and offline platforms for messages on prevention and access to services and for behavioural change, as well as to better inform UAMs and young migrants and refugees on the changes brought about by the secondary impact of Covid-19 (legal status, online safety, education paths, GBV and employment) to their entitlements. Through mobilization and engagement of UAMs, young migrants and refugees, Italians from marginalized communities, 2nd generation adolescents, young activists and volunteers, further advances were made visavis the social cohesion agenda and particularly in the promotion of the coexistence between migrant and refugee youth and Italian youth from host communities. In an effort to amplify the positive messages in order to foster positive and measurable social change new strategic partnerships were established with 2 major social media platforms targeting the Italian audience: Freeda and Scuola Zoo (https://www.scuolazoo.com/). Freeda (http://www.freedamedia.com/) has a primary focus on girls and women’s issues; Scuola Zoo caters to Italian adolescents and youth going to school.
UNICEF Migrant and Refugee Response is now looking to widen the communication platforms and channels and scope of activities in support to the three U-Report pillars of Scale, Engage and Change through development of a Podcast/Web-Radio channel.

For every child, education.
The implementation of the MYRP in the Central African Republic which is bordered by Chad, Sudan and South Sudan, Cameroon, DRC and Congo, is very challenging especially in a pre-electoral context with resurgence of armed conflicts in some areas and its intensification in many already conflict-affected parts of the country. There is a multifaceted violence due to constantly increasing of both criminal and rebel groups that have been spreading desolation throughout the country, jeopardizing the future of thousands of Central African girls and boys. Almost all the prefectures including Bangui, witnessed armed conflicts since last year and which continue to spread with more intensity and direct involvement of the armed groups leaders who were engaged in a peace process since February 2019.
Children have been dropping out of school because of the insecurity that keeps causing constant displacement in the affected areas. Schools are closed because of insecurity either attacks or occupation of schools by armed groups, movement of population or lack of teachers; The volatile situation persists as elections are scheduled for end of the year and agitation among armed  group leaders is exacerbated  in spite of their acceptance and signature of the peace accord in February 2019. The uncertainty that emerged, has direct impact on the education of hundreds of thousands of children, and due to the spread of COVID-19,school was closed for more than 3 months, the return to schools of the children remains hypothetical but dropping out is now a corollary issue added to the learning loss for those who will go back to school. Prior to COVID-19, some 290,000 pre-school and school-age children were displaced and among whom, approximately 116,000 were reported to have dropped out of school.
Even when learning activities take place, children remain at risk of long-lasting exposure to violence in and around IDP sites, resulting in dropping out as the few functional schools are overcrowded due to the increased enrolment of displaced children in these existing schools and even in the temporary learning spaces. The pupil/teacher ratio is approximately 140/1 (in many cases up to 200 pupils for one teacher in a classroom) in many IDP sites. In addition, out of school children and adolescent boys and girls are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation, including sexual abuse and exploitation, conscription into armed groups, crime and substance abuse, The constant violence weighs extremely on girls who are more likely to end up in early marriage and early pregnancies when they are not victims of gender-based violence.
In order to better improve the quality of education and attain more hard-to-reach children in crisis-affected areas, UNICEF, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MEPS), set up a radio education programme for the school year 2019-2020 that is currently being implemented. Additionally, UNICEF is supporting the MEPS in the implementation of the recently adopted Education Sector plan along with other donors and partners of the Local Education Group - LEG (World Bank, EU, GPE, ECHO, AFD, French Embassy, UNESCO …). UNICEF also developed strong partnership with both international and national NGO to ensure the implementation of interventions related to access to quality education for children and adolescents (3 – 17 years) with focus on Education in Emergencies (including the implementation of its COVID-19 response plan and early childhood development/pre-learning. 
 Job organizational context 
The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Joint-Programme Manager is responsible for the overall management and implementation of the Central African ECW Multi-Year-Resilience Programme (MYRP), with a more than USD19 million budget since 2018 including the First Emergency Response funds (FER) to support government in the implementation of its COVID-19 response plan. The incumbent coordinates the ECW joint programme activities, leads the effective implementation of the overall programme, collaborates with the Education Cluster and ensure the coordination of the Joint Programme Steering Committee. He/she reports to UNICEF and plays the role of liaison with the ECW Secretariat Country Lead. 
The programme aims to provide access to education for 500,000 conflict-affected children and out of school children and adolescents through community based and innovative approaches. The ECW-funded programme creates an inclusive teaching and learning environment for conflict-affected and out of school girls and boys; improves continuity of education by facilitating opportunities for students to transition to from lower to higher grades; improves the quality of learning; and create safer and more protective learning environments and ensures learning assessments.

With USD19 million available as seed funding for the first two year of the MYRP implementation, the programme aims to provide access to 432,000 conflict-affected and out of school children and adolescents in the country. Four subgrantees have been selected and are involved in the programme implementation since the Year 1 of the MYRP and funding for Year 2 has been made available end of August 2020.

Nigeria Country Office is one of the largest operations of UNICEF and the largest in the West and Central African Region. The country programming is complex as it has development programming, with major disparities between the North and the South, North being relatively deprived and poor, while majority of the population is concentrated in the North. The country is further challenged with ethnic and religious divide coupled with governance issues particularly financial management.
While the Country Programme is geared towards achieving the nexus between humanitarian and development programming, due to the enormous multidimensional and complex socio-economic, extremism and political challenges the management and oversight of the delivery of the programmes often permeates into managing two parallel programming to respond to the humanitarian crisis in the North East spreading into North Central and North West and regular programming in the rest of the country.

Organizational Context
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

1-Background and purpose
Iran is dealing with COVID-19 outbreak since February 2019. In the current situation where physical distancing has limited the commute of CWD to rehabilitation and training centers of SWO, access of these children to education and rehabilitation services has been disrupted. In addition, SWO’s evidence confirms several parents of CWD who get service from SWO, faced with economic challenges, such as loss of job, decrease in income, and accordingly faced with difficulties in providing basic life necessities, such as shelter, food, and health and sanitation. Failure to control the longer-term effects of this pandemic will result in CWD to have unpleasant experiences of disability exacerbation, drop out from school, fail to develop skills and capacities to integrate into the society at older ages.
In response to the needs of children with disabilities (CWD) in COVID-19 situation, State Welfare Organization (SWO) has developed a ‘Remote Rehabilitation Programme for CWD. Considering the fact that CWD’s development to their full potential, requires a multi-dimensional and multisectoral approach, SWO is going to further establish and lead a cross sectoral coordination system at national and subnational levels which also works as an accelerator for the remote rehabilitation programme by facilitating cross sectoral cooperation, resources and social mobilization specifically at subnational level. As a first step,  SWO has established a ’multi-sectoral committee for promotion of CWDs rights’ (CWD committee) with membership of different stakeholders, namely: MCLSW, Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Sports and Youth (MOSY), Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Ministry of Interior (MOI), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), active NGOs in the field of disability, and academicians for promotion of the rights of CWD. 
Therefore, under the Programme of Cooperation (2019-2020) between SWO Rehabilitation Department (SWO) and UNICEF, UNICEF and SWO,  want to hire a technical consultant to support SWO to develop CWD committee’s standard operating procedure as well as an action plan, as explained in this TOR.

How can you make a difference?
Background and purpose
The Government of Rwanda is strongly committed to ensuring that all children can achieve their full potential in a safe and protective environment. However, children and adolescents still face violence, abuse and exploitation. Despite violence being often under-reported, figures from the National Violence Against Children and Youth Study (2015/16) show that 42% of boys and 26% of girls aged 13-17 have been victims of physical violence, while 12% of girls and 5% of boys aged 13-17 reported exposure to sexual violence.
Access to the internet is rapidly increasing. According to Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) internet penetration stood at 62.9% as of March 2020 whereas access to mobile-cellular telephones was at 74.8% by the end of 2019. With the rise in affordability of smart phone devices, flexible pricing of Internet bundles as well as the extension of 3G and 4G coverage around the country, the access to digital life is even expected to exponentially increase in near future. The One Laptop per Child and Smart Classrooms programs have increased access to digital world specifically in school settings and new initiatives in the future will substantially expand internet coverage. With the current COVID-19 crisis and schools in Rwanda closed to mitigate the spread of virus, most services have now been put online, including children’s learning, socialization and play. This presents even greater exposure of children to the internet with greater potential for online risks and harms. The need for protection online is critical as children constitute half of Rwanda’s population.
Recognizing the need to keep children safe in digital life, the Government of Rwanda has adopted the Child Online Protection Policy in 2019. The Rwanda Child Online Protection Policy (“the COP Policy”) is designed to mitigate against online risks and harms, and to deliver a framework that meets children’s needs and fulfils their rights, while enabling them to safely and confidently navigate the digital environment. It represents the Government’s full commitment to the safety and wellbeing of children, the nation’s greatest and most precious asset.
The implementation of the policy requires the involvement of a broad spectrum of stakeholders; government and public agencies, information and communications technology companies, telecommunication companies; communities and civil society organisations; parents, teachers and children themselves have to exercise a shared responsibility in the implementation of this policy. Comprehensive child online protection is dependent upon stakeholder’s partnership; working nationally and internationally.
The Government has already established the governance structure for the implementation of the policy. The National Steering Committee on Child Online Protection to provide the overall guidance and the National Technical Working Group on Child Online protection composed of a range of technical experts to offer technical guidance to the implementation of the policy. The implementation of other activities under different policy pillars have also started. UNICEF currently supports the implementation of the policy.

For every child,
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

Sudan, surrounded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya and South Sudan, positioned next to East, West, South and North Africa, is surrounded by complex conflicts in an unpredictable, volatile and rapidly evolving region. Sudan is by size the third biggest country in Africa, with a diverse population of around 42 million people. Sudan’s children make up half of the total population, and the past two decades have seen their lives significantly improve: fewer girls and boys are dying before their fifth birthday, primary school attendance is increasing, immunization coverage is high and the country remains polio free. Still, millions of children continue to suffer from protracted conflict in Darfur, the Kordofan’s, and Blue Nile, from seasonal natural disasters, malnutrition and disease outbreaks, and from under-investment in basic social services. More than three million of Sudan’s school aged children are not in the classroom. UNICEF has been in Sudan since 1952 and continues with a presence in 12 of Sudan’s 18 states.

Overview
Education Cannot Wait (ECW) is commissioning the development of a Capacity Development Framework that provides the ECW Secretariat Staff and its partners with a clear understanding of and systematic approach towards capacity development in crisis affected contexts through its Investment Windows and Secretariat technical staff.
Background & Rationale
Education Cannot Wait (ECW) is the global fund to transform the delivery of education in emergencies - one that joins up governments, humanitarian actors and development efforts to deliver a more collaborative and rapid response to the educational needs of children and youth affected by crises. ECW was launched at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 by a broad coalition of international aid agencies and public and private donors to usher in faster and more sustainable education responses in crises settings. Guided by the ECW Strategic Plan 2018-2021[1], the Secretariat realizes five core functions: (1) inspire political commitment to financing education in humanitarian contexts, (2) catalyze financial resources; (3) facilitate joint programming between humanitarian and development actors; (4) strengthen capacity to respond to crises; and (5) improve accountability. ECW is hosted and administered under UNICEF's financial, human resources and administrative rules and regulations, while operations are run by the ECW’s own independent governance structure that provides strategic guidance and oversight to its investments. ECW's day-to-day activities are carried out by a Secretariat under the direction of the ECW Director.
The fourth core function, ‘Strengthen Capacity to Respond to Crises’, is aimed at various capacity spaces. ECW invests in strengthening capacity for response and recovery, working with partners to identify and fill capacity gaps in specific crises and supporting broader global efforts to increase capacity across the education sector. In particular, ECW seeks to strengthen the capacity of the Education Cluster to coordinate education in emergencies responses. ECW investments may also include financial support to strengthen national capacity; foster greater coherence across preparedness, assessment and planning, including emergency to development transition planning; and increase both response capacity and strengthen coordination mechanisms to support national responses. Through its financing instruments ECW invests in local partners directly or indirectly through UN agencies, NGOs or existing mechanisms.


How can you make a difference?


ECW’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 highlights that the Secretariat will develop a Capacity Development Framework that will guide efforts at the global and local levels in terms of strengthening capacities. The Strategic Plan provides the ‘why’ of the ECW Secretariat’s work and the Capacity Development Framework will provide ‘what (i.e. competencies)’ and ‘how (i.e. approach)’. The Capacity Development Framework will provide ECW Secretariat Staff and its partners with a clear understanding of and systematic approach towards capacity development. It should identify the competencies that should be strengthened, articulate the principles of capacity development and the concrete steps that the Secretariat will take to achieve its objectives.
Scope
The scope of work will include the following. It is expected that this will be further refined during the inception phase. 

Identify competencies (Knowledge, skills and behaviors) that ECW seeks to strengthen through its partnerships, three funding windows (FER, MYRP and AF) and Secretariat Staff[1] and the competences that the Secretariat Staff should have to strengthen capacities at the global, regional and local levels.
Develop a Capacity Development Framework that has two main levels based on the competency framework, whereby ECW’s three investment windows will serve as the primary mechanism through which the Secretariat develops capacity supported by ECW Secretariat Staff in the Field Investment Workstream
The Capacity Development Framework will include the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of interventions to strengthen identified competencies.
Orient the Capacity Development Framework within similar or complementary Frameworks of the EiE Sector

ECW’s three funding windows will feature prominently in the Capacity Development Framework. ECW envisions utilizing the Acceleration Facility to enhance international and national capacity of organizational, networks and coordination mechanisms. The focus would be on standards, practices, systems, coordination mechanism and EiE structures. ECW envisions utilizing the First Emergency Response and Multi-Year Resilience Programme Investment windows to development capacities at the country level. The focus will be on realizing ECW’s commitments to the Grand Bargain localization agenda, organizational capacity to respond to crises, including with civil society organizations as well as relevant ministries, departments and agencies and the cultivation of networks that focus on thematic issues, among other areas.
While the Capacity Development Framework will be grounded in ECW’s Strategic Plan, it will ensure coherence with other ECW strategies, plans and frameworks, such as the ECW Operational Manual, ECW Acceleration Facility Strategy, ECW Gender Strategy, and ECW Gender Policy and Accountability Framework. The Capacity Development Framework will also ensure coherence with other important international commitments, such as the Grand Bargain. It is expected that the consultant will also consult relevant frameworks developed by ECW partners, such as INEE and the Global Education Cluster, to identify synergies and areas of collaboration and duplication. A full list of documents will be agreed upon during the inception phase of the assignment.
A Capacity Development Framework should be collectively adopted by partners and serve as a guide for FER and MYRP partners. It is underpinned by ongoing learning and adaptation, sustainability, and the integration of activities at various levels to address complex problems. A capacity development approach must bring about transformation.
The CDF should include among other elements the following:  

A definition of Capacity Development in the context of ECW Investments aligned to the global policy and agenda on provision of education in the context of emergencies and protracted crises.
An elaboration of the Capacity Development space to include recipients of ECW customarily works with various methodologies capturing the impact of context on the use of such methodologies and the range of capacities to be developed.

An outline of the process of capacity development in thematic areas

Recommendation of effective strategies for working with in country partners, including government, donors, civil society and implementing partners.
A flow chart of when and how technical support in each area is transferred to capable local experts who meet minimum standards of expertise in each technical area
Criteria to map, assess the capacity, and select best practice local technical NGOs/experts in specific technical areas based on ECW commitments and expected results.
Concrete, actionable practical recommendations to drive capacity developments forward so that they are more strategic, sustainable, uniform and comprehensive.

Tasks and Expected results
Under the supervision of the Chief of Education, the consultant is expected to undertake the following tasks:
1) Submit an inception report. The inception report should demonstrate the consultant's understanding of the assignment and approach for completing each task. The inception report will include a work plan that proposes how the consultant will undertake the assignment, including a schedule for consultations with Secretariat staff and partner organizations and the methodology to identify the competencies and develop the framework.  This should also include a draft structure for the Capacity Development Framework.
2)  Undertake an analysis to A) identify and develop a framework of competencies to be strengthened through implementation of the Capacity Development Framework and B) capacity development activities that are required of the ECW Secretariat Education Team and the expected skill-sets that are needed to perform the activities. This will include, but are not limited to: 

Conduct a desk study of ECW’s country investments, (ECW strategic plan and operational manual, commitment to the Grand Bargain and relevant principles on effectives within the Humanitarian-Development etc.)
Conduct remote key informant interviews, with the entire Secretariat technical team and a selected group of in-country grantees  
Produce a concise analytical document that outlines the findings

3) Prepare the Capacity Development Framework. The Capacity Development Framework will include the following elements:



A conceptual framework for the Capacity Development Framework
Competency Framework
Capacity Development interventions and strategies



Final documents will be put through several rounds of review with the education team; suggested changes from the first review will be integrated by the consultant*
* Number and date of draft submissions required is subject to change pending forthcoming guidance and adjustments to timeline.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
 
For every child, results
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

Accessibility helps children and adults with disabilities to enjoy their rights as outlined in Human Rights instruments and development frameworks. Accessibility is a precondition for children and adults with disabilities to live independently and participate fully and equally in society.
 
While committed to promoting equity and inclusion at the global level, UNICEF has also made efforts to build an inclusive organisation and working environment.
 
In 2011, UNICEF issued an Executive Directive on Disability (CF/EXD/2011-005) which articulated the organisation’s commitment to employment of persons with disabilities and protecting the rights of staff in terms of opportunities, remuneration and safe working environment; ensuring non-discrimination during recruitment and selection, training and career advancement as well as retention; providing reasonable accommodation for employment; ensuring confidentiality of information shared with the Organisation; and training and awareness raising on disability for all staff.
 
The Division of Human resources created the Disability Accommodation Fund, a dedicated budget line which provides staff with reasonable accommodation in terms of access to buildings, flexible working arrangement, special work equipment of travel arrangements and additional time allocations when required. An Executive Directive on Flexible Workplace (CF/AI/2008-2007) ensures staff with and without disabilities can request flexibility in work hours and arrangements.
 
To ensure efficient support is readily available, UNICEF is seeking services of an individual contractor who will assist Staff Counselor in her daily activities and tasks.

LOCATION/DURATION:
Duration                            : Nov 2020 – Oct 2021 (11.5 month timeframe)

BACKGROUND:
UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to protect the rights of every child. UNICEF has spent over 70 years working to improve the lives of children and their families. Defending children's rights throughout their lives requires a global presence, aiming to produce results and understand their effects. UNICEF believes all children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfill their potential – to the benefit of a better world.
UNICEF MENA Regional Office based at Amman in Jordan works across 16 country and area offices. The region is one of the largest and most complex in UNICEF, with a range of country typologies and several on-going large-scale emergencies. The region has low levels of per capita income relative to its wealth, high levels of illiteracy, poor health and educational outcomes in comparison with countries of comparable income levels; gender inequalities; presence of harmful social norms and practices such as child marriage and FGM/C as well as violence against children and GBV; high youth unemployment; authoritarianism; and acute conflicts with mass internal and external displacement. The region is also characterized by increasing vulnerability to climate change, pressure on water resources, infectious disease outbreaks and constraints on civil society participation. UNICEF MENARO works across the region to support country offices to more effectively deliver better results for children, through enhancing programme excellence in health, nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene promotion, gender, child protection and education; generating and disseminating public goods; and strengthening organizational management effectiveness and efficiency. Emergency response and humanitarian actions undergird all areas. To streamline and strengthen technical support to and engagement with countries for accelerated results, MENARO has prioritized four ‘regional accelerator areas’: ending violence against children, climate change and water scarcity, life skills education and employability for adolescents and youth, and social policy and protection systems for children. A fifth – improving child and maternal health through strengthening of primary health care under the Universal Health Care agenda is under consideration given the strong political commitment and humanitarian and development focus on this across the region.
Communication for Development (C4D) is a core cross-cutting function and strategy of UNICEF MENARO to enhance programme excellence and strengthen results in the area of social norms, behavior change, and community-based prevention and promotion strategies. The C4D Section at MENARO provides on an ongoing basis, technical oversight and support to country offices to improve the scale, quality, impact and sustainability of social norms and behavior change interventions in support of country programme results. C4D interventions are also often at the forefront of UNICEF emergency response, where knowledge, attitudes, practices and social norms play key role in adoption of life-saving and protective behaviours. For instance, the recent, ongoing and unprecedented COVID 19 pandemic, wherein UNICEF is playing a co-leadership role in risk communication and community engagement, has highlighted the increasing demand for C4D expertise, capacity and support across all countries and sectors in the region. C4D principles and practice also undergird all areas of the regional accelerators that MENARO has identified as priority and requires close collaboration and engagement with child protection, education, WASH, Health and adolescent teams across the regional and country levels.
Over the past three years, the C4D Section has established or contributed to several cross-country and cross-regional initiatives. Key among them are the creation of a package of tools including a conceptual framework, a guide for programming, and a monitoring framework for social and behaviour change programmes. The package of tools is linked to the design of a major cross-regional evidence generation initiative with West and Central Africa, as well as East and South Africa Regions (WCAR, ESAR) on key child protection issues (child labour, child marriage, female genital mutilation and child discipline) that is currently ongoing. Results from this multi-country research initiative, that is expected to be completed in 2021, will drive improvements in policy and programming strategies that will be implemented across countries to achieve social norms and behavior change. The Section, in collaboration with Child Protection, Education, ECD, Adolescent and other teams is also contributing majorly to the development and advancement of a parenting approach in the region that cuts across sectors and life cycle phases. Lastly, building on its role in the COVID response, the section is investing strongly in capacity development and information sharing, monitoring of country progress, knowledge management, identification of good practice and documentation of emerging good practices and lessons learned. To support the areas highlighted above, the C4D Section at UNICEF MENARO is interested to hire the services of an experienced expert in C4D or related social and behavioural sciences with strong experience in and understanding of the local regional context and prevailing social and gender norms. The consultant will focus on operational engagement with education, protection and other cross-cutting regional thematic teams (adolescents, ECD, gender, monitoring and evaluation) linked especially to the regional accelerators, and provide technical support to C4D teams within country offices in this regard.
PURPOSE:
The C4D Consultant will report to the Regional Advisor, C4D for day to day supervision and guidance. The Consultant will provide technical inputs and support to strengthen ongoing and specific C4D/SBCC packages and activities initiated by the C4D Section, with a focus on regional accelerators linked to the education, child and social protection, as well as gender, adolescent and ECD portfolios, as highlighted below. The consultant will also support select capacity development, information and knowledge management needs, products and processes of the C4D Section at MENARO linked to the same. For this, the consultant will be expected to engage with both regional and country level UNICEF teams and partners as relevant.

1. Objectifs
L’objectif général de la mission du/de la consultant(e) est d’apporter un appui technique à la réalisation du Bilan et à l’élaboration du Plan National Multisectoriel pour la Nutrition, l’Alimentation et de Développement de la Petite Enfance (PNMNADPE 2021-2025).
Plus spécifiquement, il s’agira de :
- Faire une analyse des forces, faiblesses, menaces et opportunités de la mise en oeuvre du PNMN 2016-2020 ;- Evaluer le niveau d’atteinte des cibles des indicateurs tels que définis dans le Cadre Commun des Résultats (CCR) ;- Recenser les contraintes et difficultés rencontrées par les parties prenantes dans la mise en oeuvre du PNMN 2016-2020 ;- Recueillir les attentes des parties prenantes ;- Recenser les défis et proposer des axes stratégiques en lien avec ces défis ;- Elaborer le PNMNADPE 2021-2025.
2. Méthodologie et Approche Technique
Le travail sera mené de manière consultative et inclusive avec les parties prenantes du PNMN 2016-2020. Le consultant travaillera sous la supervision d’une équipe mise en place au sein du SE-CONNAPE. Des rencontres seront organisées régulièrement au SE-CONNAPE pour le suivi de l’état d’avancement de la consultance.
De manière technique, l’élaboration PNMNADPE 2021-2025 se fera en deux (02) étapes :
- La réalisation de la revue du PNMN 2016-2020 ;- L’élaboration de nouveau Plan (PNMNADPE 2021-2025).
Les responsables des ministères sectoriels et des réseaux membres du CONNAPE en charge du suivi technique et financier feront leurs rapports respectifs selon leurs axes d’interventions dans le Cadre Commun de Résultats (CCR) du PNMN. Ces rapports devront ressortir les données relatives aux éléments suivants :
- État d’exécution physique et financière des projets/programmes à travers lesquels sont mises en oeuvre les actions prioritaires et/ou les activités sectorielles de nutrition ;- État d’exécution physique des actions prioritaires du Cadre Commun de Résultats du PNMN ;- État des ressources financières mobilisées en faisant ressortir les contributions du budget de l’Etat (part Trésor) et des Partenaires au Développement ;- Niveau de réalisation des indicateurs du Cadre Commun de Suivi et Evaluation (CCSE) du PNMN suivi d’une analyse de la performance sectorielle ;- Difficultés rencontrées et solutions envisagées ;- Leçons tirées de la mise en oeuvre du PNMN ;- Défis actuels et propositions d’axes stratégiques en lien avec lesdits défis sectoriels.
L’analyse ou l’examen de ces différentes données permettra de mesurer le niveau d’atteinte des résultats définis en 2016. On vérifiera également si les objectifs sont toujours d’actualités et en cohérence avec les attentes des populations.

BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
Every year, over 1 billion children experience violence. Violence in childhood undermines all other investments in children; in their health, education and development, often with negative lifelong consequences and intergenerational impact. Recognizing the devastating impacts of violence against children, in 2015 world leaders committed to end all forms of violence, abuse and neglect by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.  In July 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and an associated Fund.
The Partnership includes governments, UN agencies, international organizations, civil society, faith groups, the private sector, philanthropic foundations, research practitioners, academics and children themselves - uniting their voices, actions and resources in a unique public-private collaboration focused solely on ending violence against all children. In its first four years, the Partnership has: enrolled 30 governments as 'Pathfinder' countries; encouraged 15 countries to endorse the Safe to Learn Call to Action, grown its membership to over 450 organizations; helped develop and promote the INSPIRE solutions to end violence; awarded more than $35 million in grants to tackle online child sexual abuse, and violence against children in conflict and crises; and galvanized those working to end violence through an inaugural End Violence Solutions Summit.

Après une année de mise en œuvre et for des acquis, 12 autres districts ont été sélectionnés suivant les mêmes critères. Des ateliers d’analyse des goulots d’étranglement a l’accès et l’utilisation des services de vaccination ont été tenus dans 21 districts et ont abouti au développement des plans d’amélioration du PEV basés sur l’approche ACE/Equite. Et pour soutenir leur mise en œuvre, une assistance technique a été mise en place dans les bureaux de zone UNICEF de Kayes, Mopti et Sikasso pour appuyer les Directions Régionales de la Sante.

I. Contexte
Après une première analyse faite devant la persistance de la stagnation de la couverture vaccinale, 11 districts ont été sélectionnés comme prioritaires sur base des critères suivants : i) nombre élevé d’enfants non-vaccines ; ii) taux d’abandon Penta1/Penta3 élevé. Il s’agit des districts des régions de Kayes (Bafoulabe, Diéma, Kéniéba, Kita), Sikasso (Bougouni, Koutiala, Yorosso), Ségou (Macina, Niono), Bamako (Commune1 et Commune 6). Après une année de mise en œuvre et for des acquis, 12 autres districts ont été sélectionnés suivant les mêmes critères. Des ateliers d’analyse des goulots d’étranglement a l’accès et l’utilisation des services de vaccination ont été tenus dans 21 districts et ont abouti au développement des plans d’amélioration du PEV basés sur l’approche ACE/Equite. Et pour soutenir leur mise en œuvre, une assistance technique a été mise en place dans les bureaux de zone UNICEF de Kayes, Mopti et Sikasso pour appuyer les Directions Régionales de la Sante. L’appui de ces assistants techniques a permis :
- L’amélioration de la planification par l’optimisation des séances de vaccination ; ce qui a permis d’accroitre l'accès et l'utilisation équitable des services de vaccination qui répondent aux besoins des communautés. 
- Le renforcement de capacités des ressources humaines de acteurs des districts dans la vaccination qui a pallié l’insuffisance qualitative.
- Le suivi régulier des stocks de vaccins et d’intrants qui a permis d’améliorer leur disponibilité des intrants de vaccination dans les formations sanitaires
- Une meilleure maitrise de la situation des équipements de chaine de froid qui a permis de garantir la qualité des vaccins aux points de prestation.
- La mise en place des cadres d’engagement et de redevabilité entre l’administration à travers les préfets et les maires, les présidents des ASACO, les représentantes des Femmes et/ou des jeunes, autres représentants des communautés et les services de santé, - La mise en place des plateformes communautaires rurales et urbaines afin de promouvoir la demande et l’utilisation des services de vaccination à travers les visites à domicile et causeries éducatives au sein des regroupements féminins et la recherche active des enfants non ou incomplètement vaccines et leur orientation vers les services de vaccination.
- La collecte et partage hebdomadaire de la situation épidémiologique sur les maladies évitables par la vaccination de leur zone de responsabilité.
Au cours de l’évaluation conjointe de juillet 2019 qui a porté sur les résultats du 2eme semestre 2018 et le 1er semestre 2019, la pertinence de la poursuite de l’assistance technique décentralisée a été reconnue.  Voilà pourquoi Gavi a consenti de financer de nouveau cette assistance technique pour permettre à l’UNICEF de poursuivre l’accompagnement des DS prioritaires par la mise à disposition de ressources humaines au niveau décentralisé.
Les présents TDRs s’inscrivent dans la cadre de recrutement des 3 Assistants techniques (Immunization Officer) pour renforcer la mise en œuvre de l’approche ACD/équité développée dans les plans d’action des 23 districts prioritaires des régions de Kayes, Mopti, Ségou et Sikasso

UNICEF travaille dans certaines parties du monde qui sont les plus difficiles, pour atteindre les enfants les plus désavantagés au monde. Pour sauver leurs vies. Pour défendre leurs droits.

Pour chaque enfant, un champion 
La mission fondamentale de l’UNICEF est de promouvoir les droits de chaque enfant, partout dans le monde et dans toutes les activités de l’organisation (programmes, plaidoyers, opérations). La stratégie d’équité, qui cible les enfants et les familles les plus défavorisés et les plus marginalisés, s’attache à concrétiser cet engagement en faveur des droits des enfants sous forme d’actions. Par « équité », l’UNICEF entend le fait que tous les enfants puissent survivre, se développer et réaliser pleinement leur potentiel sans discrimination, préjugé ou favoritisme. Les droits d’un enfant ne sont pas respectés dès lors qu’il se voit refuser tout ou partie des possibilités auxquelles il a légitimement droit, dans les dimensions sociale, politique, économique, civique et culturelle de sa vie. Il apparaît de plus en plus clairement que des investissements dans la santé, l’éducation et la protection des citoyens les plus défavorisés — pour lutter contre les inégalités — permettront non seulement à tous les enfants de réaliser pleinement leur potentiel, mais contribueront également à la croissance et la stabilité durables des pays. C’est pourquoi cibler les inégalités revêt une telle importance. Cela permet d’accélérer les progrès vers la réalisation des droits fondamentaux de tous les enfants, qui constitue le mandat universel de l’UNICEF, tel que défini dans la Convention relative aux droits de l’enfant, tout en favorisant le développement équitable des pays.

UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, Support
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children's rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society's most disadvantaged citizens addressing inequity not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

BACKGROUND: 
UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. And we never give up. UNICEF, with its universal mandate, has established effective linkages between humanitarian and development programming and supports countries to strengthen capacities and systems when preparing and responding to emergencies.
The pharmaceutical industry and the international development community has promoted the use of global data standards to provide a wider and harmonized framework for supply chain visibility, strengthening anti-counterfeiting measures and sharing of data between parties. In this context, the Inter-Agency Supply Chain Group (ISG), with World Health Organisation (WHO) as the host, issued a note in 2017 supporting recommendations to:
1. Work with countries in creating policy frameworks to support GS1 standards adoption. 2. Align national supply chain policies regarding standards harmonization.3. Support & encourage investment in digital infrastructure in countries to implement national product traceability systems.
According to a BBC news report, the coronavirus has seen a surge in the production and distribution of falsified and counterfeit medical products, particularly those reported in the media as potential therapies for COVID-19. The anticipated high demand and price point of the new COVID-19 vaccine will only see intensified falsification efforts by criminal syndicates and high incidences of diversion/theft of the authentic vaccine once released. The highest risk is in low- and middle-income countries, where governance systems are not fully mature and tools and technical capacity to ensure good practices in manufacturing, quality control and distribution is limited. WHO estimates the trade in falsified and counterfeit medical products in low- and middle-income countries to be more than 30 billion dollars per year.
UNICEF works with various global partner organisations (including USAID, GAVI, WHO, World Bank, Global Fund) as part of a global health community supporting low- and middle-income countries prepare for and implement traceability systems that would significantly reduce the risk of proliferation of falsified pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other health technologies. One critical enabler for this goal is the adoption of a set of common coding standards, without which the implementation of traceability capabilities becomes unrealistic. Common coding standards would allow for standardised product identification and verification, thereby reducing inherent risks, complexities and costs. The chosen common coding standard in this instance is the GS1 standard.
While the implementation of traceability solutions in countries is typically a long-term initiative, the coronavirus has brought the need to develop a traceability solution in the near term, which can be scaled into a national system in the future. Because of the commitment to vaccine and pharmaceutical safety UNICEF, together with global partners has embarked on a programme of work to evaluate and explore options for a ‘minimal viable traceability’ model that could be deployed across countries to enable the traceability of health products in the very near term. This initiative would be coordinated through a global expert group comprising manufacturers, distributors, national regulatory authorities, traceability experts from public and private sector, UNICEF, the World Bank and other leading health financing and development organizations. UNICEF will play a co-leadership role including technical contribution towards a viable product.
The role of the Expert Group will include defining a clear strategy and plan which maps out the discrete processes and steps needed for a ‘minimal viable solution’, their impacts, where and when the various investments will be needed, where and when the benefits will be accrued and realised including roadmaps for the implementation of traceability, using GS1 standards. UNICEF therefore requires the services of a technical expert, to provide technical inputs in support of this traceability initiative.
OBJECTIVE:
The broad objective of the assignment is to ensure vaccine and pharmaceutical safety by reducing the risk of falsified and counterfeit products entering national supply chains. This objective would be achieved by providing a tool that enables unique identification, tracing and authentication capabilities at country level.
The specific objective of the assignment is to provide in-depth technical guidance and support to UNICEF and the Traceability Expert Group under the auspices of the WB Global Steering Group on Quality Assurance that leads to the development of a viable generic traceability model for rapid deployment in low- and middle-income countries. It is expected that the guidance provided shapes and culminates into a minimum viable traceability solution that can be presented to stakeholders for adoption.
 
DESCRIPTION OF ASSIGNMENT:
The assignment entails supporting the design from conceptual stage of a high quality scalable generic traceability solution that provides minimum traceability capabilities at country level. The assignment also includes supporting national governments in low- and middle-income countries prepare and deploy the identified minimally viable track and trace solutions for the specifically defined health technologies i.e. vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. To execute this assignment, the consultant will primarily work with UNICEF and will be part of Traceability Expert Group hosted by the World Bank and work with other relevant national government agencies such as National Regulatory Authorities, Ministries of Health etc. to complete the assignment.
The consultant will report to the Chief of Supply Chain Strengthening Centre UNICEF Supply Division and perform the following tasks;
i) Provide GS1/track and trace SME expertise and ‘honest brokering’ to assist the development of a generic minimally viable traceability model for supplies (vaccines, therapeutics and medical devices) including support towards development of a clear strategy and plan which maps out the discrete processes and steps needed for a ‘minimal viable solution’
ii) Provide expert guidance on traceability strategy and plan for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics clearly articulating;
o the benefits to be gained and how local and international stakeholder in the eco-system can share these benefitso the risks to acquiring these benefits and mitigation strategieso Defining the investments needed and when for a traceability solution including who should be investingo Propose high level architectures of traceability models that should be used for a minimally viable solutiono Facilitate consensus around a generic traceability model by providing technical arguments for proposed solution including regulatory alignment.
iii) Produce a clear set of communication materials to share with countries
iv) To act as GS1 SME within UNICEF and to prepare and deliver communication, briefing and training materials including providing advice on serial number data exchange platforms
v) Work with other organisations such as USAID, GAVI, WHO, GS1 and regulators to communicate the functionality of the proposed model including the relevant processes and capabilities required for the management/distribution of master data at all relevant levels.
vi) Provide subject matter expertise to the implementation network to help clarify requirements the downstream, in market, national operations.
vii) Support pilot initiatives to trial the use of coding and traceability across national supply chains for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in 1-2 countries. Document success and challenges for communication to other countries.
viii) Build an implementation network of key contacts and leads across the supply chain to enable the execution of the implementation roadmaps in pilot countries.

Information about the consultancy
Type of the Consultancy:  Individual Consultant
Proposed level of Consultancy: Senior Level
Hiring Section: Health
Duration: 2 Months
Background
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is an integrated approach to child health that focuses on the well-being of the child. IMCI aims to reduce death, illness and disability, and to promote improved growth and development among children under five years of age. IMCI includes both preventive and curative interventions that are implemented by families and communities as well as by health facilities.
The strategy includes three main components:

Improving case management skills of health-care staff
Improving overall health systems
Improving family and community health practices.

In health facilities, the IMCI strategy promotes the accurate identification of childhood illnesses in outpatient settings, ensures appropriate combined treatment of all major illnesses, strengthens the counselling of caretakers, and speeds up the referral of severely ill children. In the home setting, it promotes appropriate care seeking behaviours, improved nutrition and preventative care, and the correct implementation of prescribed care.
Therefore, IMCI aims at enhancing or ensuring good quality of health services by improving health provider’s skills in case management of childhood illness through training and at improving provision of essential drugs, supplies and equipment in order to reduce disease incidence.To contribute to reduction in child morbidity and mortality, Rwanda adapted IMCI tools and strategy to the context of the country in 2002. From 2006 to 2009 the trainings of trainers and providers practicing in health facilities were trained on this approach.
In 2020 the  IMCI tools has been updated according to the new protocols, cognizant that the booklet and the tools used in IMCI are in French while some health care providers mostly those graduating from different schools are using more English than French, there is a need to translate the booklet of IMCI and the tools used in IMCI into English to have these documents in two languages with view to avoid language barriers in implementing IMCI.

Purpose of Activity/Assignment: Provide technical support to the Child Protection Programme in Dadaab and Fafi refugee hosting areas, including contextualizing and incorporating the UNICEF child protection programme within the Garissa County Socio-Economic Development Programme.
 

Scope of Work: Background
UNICEF Kenya 2018-2022 Country Programme aims to ensure that children, particularly those facing disparity and inequity, have their rights realized through cross-sectoral interventions that address multiple deprivations. One priority area within the child protection component of the Country Programme focuses on children in refugee context, both asylum seekers and within refugee hosting communities. UNICEF aims to strengthen systems for integrated service delivery, ensuring every needy child, irrespective of status, receives required services and support. In aligning with the design of the forthcoming Garissa Integrated Socio-Economic Development Plan (GISEDP) and learning from the Kalobeyei Socio-Economic Development Programme (KISEDP), UNICEF will promote child protection systems strengthening and support strategies on mainstreaming refugee and children on the move programming in the national child protection system.
Programming for the refugee population falls under humanitarian response that is aligned to UNICEF Core Commitment for Children in Humanitarian Crisis and other emergency response policies and procedures. UNICEF Child Protection work in Dadaab Refugee Camp entails partnership with UNHCR and relevant agencies in providing a safe and protective environment for unregistered, unaccompanied, separated and other vulnerable children exposed to risk of harm. UNICEF supports strengthening case and information management implementation for the vulnerable children in Dadaab. Therefore, to ensure effective and efficient service delivery to children, UNICEF seeks to focus on systems strengthening, capacity building for case workers and communities, innovative scale up of the integrated service provision through model by supporting the completion of the investment case for child protection in Garissa County.
JustificationThe purpose of the Dadaab based consultancy position is to ensure delivery of quality child protection services to refugee and host communities. The consultant will provide technical guidance and oversight to UNICEF child protection implementing partners and contribute towards the work of child protection networks and coordination groups established. Through continued provision of technical support, coaching and mentoring to partners, this function would expand and solidify the gains made so far in child protection programming and would also ensure that emerging child protection issues/concerns are addressed.
The Dadaab refugee complex has a population of 220,519 (UNHCR August 2020) refugees and asylum seekers. Children constitute 57% of the camp population. UNICEF has entered into a partnership with Terre des Hommes Foundation and Save the Children International on provision of child protection services in Dadaab. Beyond the camps, UNICEF Garissa office works with the national and county government in enhancing capacity and support to most vulnerable children in Garissa County. Given the large population of children in the camp and surrounding host community (Dadaab/Fafi Sub-Counties) and complexity of the operation and emerging protection issues, the Child Protection section proposes to engage a consultant to support this work. The consultant will ensure UNICEF child protection programme priorities are successfully implemented, participate in coordination forums and articulate the need for Dadaab camp transition decisions to prioritize the best interest of children, in the light of the Government’s intention towards a progressive camp closure. The work will entail daily contacts and coordination with partners in Dadaab and close coordination with UNHCR Dadaab, the Refugee Affairs Secretariat and the Sub-County Children Officer. The need for dedicated UNICEF child protection capacity for Dadaab has been repeatedly highlighted by a key donor during donor visits.
The design of the Garissa Integrated Socio-Economic Development Programme (GISEDP) acknowledges the social, cultural and economic inter-dependence between the refugee and host community, which also requires technical support to ensure greater integration between the refugee child protection programme and the national child protection system. UNICEF is also engaged in Garissa investment case that has assessed the resources needed for a child protection system that services both refugee and host community. This is another stream of work that requires engagement and coordination at Dadaab level as it will entail consultations with grassroot stakeholders and beneficiaries. Going forward the Consultant will also support and monitor the implementation of the Child Protection component of the PROSPECTS partnership, which also includes the roll-out of the UPSHIFT mentorship programme. This will bring in a new partner to implement this work.

Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges. 
UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves. 
In particular, UNICEF will work so that:

Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

For every child, Hope
The government, as part of the implementation of its social protection policy, developed a strategy and a national plan to support São Toméan families in which a Parental Education Program (PEP) is inserted. PEP was created in order to respond to the situation of vulnerable families in São Tomé and Príncipe, with the specific objective of strengthening the capacities of parents, guardians and educators to ensure that children benefit from parental education sensitive to gender issues, early learning and the integral development of children, adolescents and young people.
In 2016, a pilot PEP experiment was carried out that benefited about 37 vulnerable families, followed by an extension of the program in late 2017-2018 involving about 155 vulnerable families. In order to examine the implementation process, in 2019 an external evaluation of the PEP was carried out to serve as a basis for the extension of the PEP at the national level.Specifically, the evaluation highlighted that the PEP program contributed to changing parenting practices and parents' skills and knowledge to deal with children's specific problems. This, too, made it possible to examine the implementation process, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and sustainability of the PEP. In this way, recommendations were made that served as a basis for the enlargement of the PEP at the National level.
The results of the external evaluation demonstrated that the activities and products provided for in the PEP were relevant to meet the objectives of the program and adjusted to the needs of the target groups. It also demonstrated that the program's design was adapted to meet the needs of parental education on different themes relevant to the child's development.From the constraints noted, there is a weak objectivity in the stage of selection of families in which clear quantitative criteria and respective registration were not defined. It was not possible to prove whether the selected families were the ones that needed more support. Regarding the effectiveness of the program, the report highlighted the absence of a PEP monitoring system that would allow the progress of results to be recorded through previously defined indicators.The new parental education program, called PEP +, was born as a result of a partnership between UNICEF, the World Bank, the Funds for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations system (UN) and the government of São Tomé and Príncipe, namely the Directorate for Social Protection Solidarity and Family (DPSSF) of the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity, Family and Professional Training (MTSFFP). The DPSSF, as the entity responsible for implementing the National Social Protection Policy and Strategy, must coordinate all actions and follow the evolution of the entire process of this project. PEP + was conceived operationally on the basis of a theory of change reflected in a set of actions and measures to accompany and monitor the program of the beneficiary families and aligned with the SDGs, especially with the objective of “leaving no one behind”.
PEP + will not only be a complementary measure to the monetary transfers of the Vulnerable Family Program, but it is above all an integrated and articulated national intervention strategy, with several actors. To broaden and reinforce knowledge and good practices and at the same time to enable frontline employees who are in daily contact with parents and educators of children, to be equipped with skills and competences to better provide their services within the scope of PEP. Thus, it is necessary to carry out training and capacity-building sessions on the current content of the PEP, of frontline workers on the main service platforms including health, education, social services and youth. And provide technical assistance to ensure the implementation of the family training plan articulated with the monitoring system to be created simultaneously to record the progress of the results.
How can you make a difference?
MAIN OBJECTIVE
PEP + will have national coverage in order to reach as many fathers, mothers and educators as possible, causing changes in parenting practices, and continuously eliminating harmful and harmful behaviors towards children. PEP + should include new response platforms with the inclusion of frontline technicians who will benefit in a first phase of training and capacity building sessions on the existing PEP content, and develop, in a second phase, the skills necessary to answer beneficiaries’ demands.In this context, the objective of the consultancy is to recruit an international consultant / trainer to coordinate the education and training of PEP trainers, in a participatory methodology and in a decentralized approach, thus promoting the knowledge, skills and positive practices of parental behavior, and sequentially supporting in the process of supervision and monitoring of training sessions for family groups.

Terms of ReferenceTitle Consultancy to support mapping of management information system (MIS) for social protection in South Sudan Type of Contract Individual Contractor (SSA) Supervision Social Policy Specialist and second reporting, Chief, Social Policy, Planning, M&E (SPPME) sectionLevel Senior level, InternationalLocation Home based, with potentially 1 onsite mission for 1 week to deliver workshop in 2021.Duration 55 days over 6 months Start Date 15 November 2020 – 31 May 2021
Background/Rationale for the AssignmentThe National Social Protection Policy Framework (NSPPF), approved in 2015, envisages a national social protection system with strong coordination and a range of social protection programs for the most vulnerable. Social protection – which is defined in South Sudan as the set of private and public mechanisms that protect and prevent individuals and households from suffering the adverse effects of shocks and stresses – is overseen by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW). The National Social Protection Working Group (NSPWG) is the primary body for government and non-government stakeholders to discuss technical and policy aspects of social protection; build consensus on policy and programmatic issues; and coordinate to avoid duplication of efforts. Line Ministries, in particular the Ministry of General Education and Instruction and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, are mandated to mainstream social protection into existing programs and budgets, in addition to the design and implementation of social protection programs for their respective sector. To support the MGCSW’s efforts to coordinate, design, implement, monitor and evaluate social protection activities, a comprehensive mapping was undertaken in 2019, with UNICEF support. In June-July 2020, this mapping was further updated through the SPACE (DFID-GIZ) Social Protection Technical Facility for COVID19, based on the request of the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW) to UNICEF and DFID. The 2020 mapping documented programming changes, including those in response to COVID-19. Key informant interviewees for the 2020 mapping suggested the South Sudanese social protection response to COVID-19 should seek to strengthen the nexus between social protection and humanitarian action by focusing on the various Management Information Systems (MISs) used in social protection and humanitarian response. The 2020 mapping examined the following six non-contributory programs: • the South Sudan Safety Nets Project (SSSNP), funded by the World Bank, consisting of conditional cash transfers (public works) and unconditional transfers for households without able bodied individuals; • the Building Resilience through Asset Creation Phase II (BRACE II) funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), a public works program implemented by a World Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) partnership and a consortium led by World Vision; • Food for Assets (FFA), a public works / asset creation program implemented by WFP; • the Urban Safety Nets (USN) program, a cash-for-training program implemented by WFP;• the Girls Education South Sudan II (GESS II) program, funded by DFID, which includes annual cash transfers to school-age girls to help offset the costs of education; and• the School Feeding Program (SFP), implemented by WFP.Through the validation process for the 2020 mapping, stakeholders indicated their support for: (i) a mapping of MISs for social protection and related sectors in South Sudan; (ii) a literature review to synthesise lessons on information management of social protection from similar contexts; (iii) co-creation by stakeholders of a vision and series of high-level goals for management of social protection information in South Sudan; and (iv) expert technical guidance and recommendations on how the vision and goals can be achieved. The ToR produced by SPACE for the suggested assignment was reviewed by stakeholders including MoGCSW, World Bank, WFP, UNOPS, DFID and UNICEF. It was further reviewed and endorsed by the National Social Protection Working Group (NSPWG) chaired by the Under-Secretary of MoGCSW on 17 September 2020.
Rationale
A significant proportion of information for these social protection programs is managed by three different program-specific Management Information Systems (MIS). Currently, the MISs are not able to communicate with another through exchange of data (information is collected via large scale data collection processes, not through data exchange with other information systems). These MISs serve several delivery chain functions for respective programs, including: (i) registration and enrolment of beneficiaries; (ii) compliance monitoring (where applicable); (iii) management of payments; (iv) support for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes; and (v) support for on-going management and planning. The MGCSW acknowledges that MISs – and the set-up of broader information systems serving the social protection sector – are intensely complex and bring risks in conflict-affected and humanitarian contexts such as South Sudan. This is highlighted most recently in DFID-supported research which notes the challenges in linking MISs involved in humanitarian response and social protection, including the need to consider protection issues and other important trade-offs.
That said, there are a number of potential advantages to improved information management in social protection in South Sudan. These include: (I) increasing the responsiveness of social protection to large crises (e.g. natural disaster, conflict) or individual lifecycle shocks and stressors (e.g. job loss, disability, childbearing or old age); (II) strengthening coordination and linkages by supporting the planning and implementation of comprehensive social protection systems; (III) addressing inequity by supporting investment – based on objective, comprehensive and comparable information – to address the uneven and unequal provision of social protection across social groups and administrative jurisdictions; (IV) improving efficiency and effectiveness by decreasing the burden on people, staff and government systems (eg. less paperwork); (V) enabling evidence-informed decision-making and management by increasing access to relevant data at all levels of implementation; (VI) reducing gaps and duplication across programmes and along the delivery chain; (VII) supporting improved processes for identification, verification, validation, processing and analysis to better manage and prevent error and fraud,(VIII) enhancing accountability and citizen empowerment, through more transparency; providing oversight of multiple schemes and reporting; strengthened citizen engagement; and improved understanding of poverty and vulnerability.
Purpose/task & Expected Results
The purpose of the consultancy is to support the MGCSW in understanding whether there are opportunities to improve the way social protection information is managed in South Sudan, and whether there is scope to strengthen the nexus between social protection and humanitarian action with reference to the various MISs currently used. A parallel and complementary process is underway to develop a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the NSPPF by MoGCSW with UNICEF support, including the identification of common indicators across various social protection programs.
The expected outputs from the consultancy is as follows:
• (i) a mapping of MISs for social protection and related sectors in South Sudan• (ii) a literature review to synthesise lessons on information management of social protection from similar contexts• (iv) technical guidance and recommendations on how the vision and goals can be achieved in the by MoGCSW and social protection development partners in the next 3 to 5 years.
The scope of this assignment does not extend to a capacity assessment of government with regard to information management. It is acknowledged that there is currently limited government capacity in the MGCSW regarding the management and administration of programme level MIS. However, there is a strong desire by stakeholders for the Ministry to strengthen its capacity such that it can oversee and administer an MIS in the near future – whether programme specific or integrated. The World Bank is currently exploring options for a capacity assessment with a view to the government taking over the SSSNP MIS when SSSNP concludes in 2022.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.And we never give up.For every child, a fair chance
Background
The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.For more than two decades, UNICEF works closely with the national government, local representatives and civil society to improve the situation of children in Kazakhstan, ensuring equal access to quality social services, and primarily, healthcare and education.

For every Child, a fair chance
COVID-19 has already had catastrophic consequences in the Sahel, particularly in terms of its economic and social impact. Developments in the global economy (trade, commodity prices, remittances, among others) interact with existing vulnerabilities in the region and national COVID-19 measures, to affect households through a loss of income and production, higher prices, and reduced access to services and assistance. While measures instigated by governments to contain the virus may be effective, they have also brought economies to a standstill, affecting livelihoods in urban and rural areas and inadvertently amplifying food insecurity in a region where many people already struggled to access food. Urban areas are suffering both from the direct health effects and from the social measures taken to mitigate the epidemic (market closures, social distancing and curfews). Rural areas are also increasingly affected through the interruption of informal trade, the suspension of remittances, disruptions of local supply chains and inflation of staple food prices and other essential commodities. As is often the case, the most vulnerable segments of society, especially those living in extreme poverty, are bearing the brunt of the human and social impact. Through a range of impact transmission channels, COVID-19 has exposed children and women to risks of food insecurity, malnutrition, discontinued schooling, violence and abuse, or child labour. For example, an analysis of the combined impact of food insecurity and COVID-19 on acute malnutrition in 19 countries of the West and Central Africa region indicates that 15 million cases of acute malnutrition in children under five years of age are expected in 2020. This represents a 20 percent increase from earlier estimates, in January 2020.
Adequate social protection systems are essential to protect people from these consequences. National governments in the Sahel, with support from WFP and UNICEF, have developed emergency COVID-19 social protection response plans with measures aiming to protect people both from the immediate shock and its longer-term impact. However, existing social protection systems are underdeveloped in many of the contexts that need them most, and the economic and social consequences of the pandemic will quickly overwhelm national capacities.
UNICEF and WFP, with support from the German government, will implement a joint project to support the Governments of Mali, Mauritania and Niger to provide critical social assistance support in the short-term, while contributing to strengthened national social protection systems in the medium- to longer-term. In these countries, social protection systems are embryonic and stretched. Through this project, both UN agencies will provide immediate support to the three countries to respond to the massive needs generated by the pandemic, as well as help strengthen overall national capacities to adapt and build more shock-responsive, nutrition- and child-sensitive social protection systems moving forward.
The project will deliver essential cash transfers to vulnerable people affected by the socio-economic fallout of COVID-19, taking a two-track approach in cash transfer delivery and implementing complementary services. As far as possible, the project will work through government social protection programmes to deliver essential support. Where national capacities are saturated, the project will deliver cash transfers directly, in alignment with national social protection response plans. In addition, the project will provide essential complementary services, targeted to prevent a deterioration in the nutritional status of the most vulnerable women and children, and to protect children and women in targeted households from violence, abuse, exploitation, discrimination and neglect. The delivery of complementary services and the strengthening of cross-sectoral linkages as part of national social protection systems will contribute to optimizing and sustaining the impact of cash transfers among the vulnerable groups reached.
At the same time, the joint project will support national systems to become more shock-responsive, nutrition- and child-sensitive. The systems’ support aims at establishing a conducive environment for sustained coverage expansion and enhanced ability to address recurrent shocks in the medium- to long-run, whether related to COVID-19 or of different nature.
To support the implementation of the 18-month “Responding to COVID-19 Pandemic through Social Protection Systems in the Sahel” project (the COVID-19 Sahel Social Protection project) in Mali, Mauritania and Niger, the UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central Africa is recruiting a Social Policy Specialist (Shock-responsive Social Protection). The focus of the position is the provision of technical support to the three countries for the implementation of the UNICEF-managed cash transfer and social protection systems components of the project.
How can you make a difference?
Purpose for the job
The Social Policy Specialist (Shock-responsive Social Protection) will provide technical guidance and operational support to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the “Responding to COVID-19 Pandemic through Social Protection Systems in the Sahel” project, which is jointly implemented by UNICEF and WFP in Mali, Mauritania and Niger. The Specialist will support the three Country Office with their assistance to government, which entails a cash-based response to COVID-19 through existing government safety net programmes, complementary services in the areas of nutrition and child protection, and support to strengthening the child-sensitive, nutrition-sensitive, and shock-responsive capacity of national social protection systems. The Specialist will contribute to ensure that knowledge and evidence is generated from the Project to inform Social Protection engagement, capacity development, and learning in the three countries, and in fragile contexts more generally.

BACKGROUND:
Since 2016 the UNICEF Tajikistan Country Office has partnered with the Tajikistan Republican Center of Immunoprophylactic (RCIP) to implement various immunization supply chain data strengthening activities. This initiative, supported by the UNICEF Supply Division’s Monitoring Strategic Data and Evidence Data (MSDEU) Unit based in Copenhagen, aims to strengthen vaccine data management systems and promote a more data-driven approach to vaccine supply chain planning and decision-making.
The Tajikistan Ministry of Health’s Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) manages and maintains a vaccine warehouse network for the national childhood vaccine supply. This network is made up of one (1) national level warehouse, seven (7) regional warehouses, and sixty-five (65) district level warehouse and storage facilities. The warehouse network plays a critical infrastructural and operational role in ensuring the timely and effective receipt, delivery, storage, and quality assurance of the life-saving vaccines for Children.
Under 2020 GAVI Technical Country Assistance (TCA) support, the UNICEF Tajikistan Country Office is launching an initiative to strengthen the vaccine data inventory management capacity of the EPI warehouse network in Tajikistan to ultimately better support the achievement of national vaccine targets and immunization programme goals.
DESCRIPTION OF ASSIGNMENT:
UNICEF seeks a consultant to conduct a rapid assessment of the inventory data management capacity of Tajikistan’s vaccine warehouse network, and to develop a national EPI warehouse data management capacity building strategy and action plan based on the findings of the assessment. The capacity building plan would propose and detail short-term (1-2 months), medium term (3-9 months), as well as long-term (9 months or longer) activities to strengthen the warehouse system’s capacity to more efficiently and effectively manage inventory data.
The analytic framework of the inventory data management capacity assessment is expected to be organized around the following three themes: A) people, B) processes, and C) systems. The example focus areas for the assessment should include (but not necessarily limited to) the following topic areas:
People: Formalization of roles/responsibilities, availability of key competencies, staffing levels, staff supervision structure, as well as the availability of staff training programs. Processes: Data recording, reporting and analysis processes; performance management, and the coordination of inventory management with other warehouse operations. Systems: Data forms and ledgers, databases, as well as other data management systems and support tools.
The selected consultant will evaluate these functional areas with the objective of documenting and better understanding how the current warehouse data management capacities support the achievement of EPI vaccine programme goals. The assessment will identify and elaborate on the current gaps in the performance of inventory data and related recordkeeping responsibilities. The final assessment report is expected to be supported by sound qualitative analysis with well-developed arguments, and written in a clear style, accessible to both specialists and non-specialists alike.
As a part of the consultancy, the consultant will also design and implement a brief training program for EPI warehouse system staff to strengthen their logistics management data management capacity while the consultant is in Dushanbe. This capacity building training will help to address inventory data management and recordkeeping capacity challenges identified in the assessment. The consultant is also expected to develop various tools (forms, tracking sheets, template, etc.) in support of this capacity-building. The design of the training curriculum, along with the coordination/planning of the training sessions, will be done in collaboration with the UNICEF Tajikistan country office.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
South-South and triangular cooperation (SSTC) is a powerful and low-cost tool which increases global access to development solutions successfully implemented in settings commonly shared by countries in the global South. SSTC complements North-South cooperation and is recognized under SDG 17 amongst different multi-stakeholder cooperation and partnerships models for delivering the SDGs. In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly, recognizing the need to strengthen and further invigorate South-South cooperation (SSC), convened the second High-level UN conference on South-South cooperation commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) for promoting and implementing Technical Cooperation among developing countries. The Outcome Document from the Conference provided the basis for the development of the UN Strategy on SSTC which was finalized in September 2020.
Through many years now, UNICEF field offices engage in and facilitate horizontal learning, including South-South cooperation. In 2019, out of 157 programme countries that submitted COARs, 115 offices or 73%, reported that they were engaged in SSTC. UNICEF field offices reported having in place more formal and institutionalized arrangements for SSTC and that most requests for technical assistance (TA) were addressed through study visits. This consultancy will address findings and recommendations on improving efficiency and effectiveness of SSTC exchange and learning.
Enabling adaptation of solutions and good practices from country to country is at the core of SSTC. The main purpose of this consultancy is to develop and support the establishment of a Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) for SSTC in UNICEF. It will serve as a tool for more systematic provision of on-demand technical expertise globally. As highlighted in the UNICEF Tools and Support Services (TSS) on SSTC, a TAF for country-to-country learning and exchange is a major modality for SSTC and adds value by increasing the availability of relevant solutions and expertise, context-sensitive guidance and efficient technical assistance for improved programme implementation and services delivery beyond borders. A global TAF for SSTC in UNICEF is expected to a) make it easier to submit requests (demand-side); b) improve matchmaking of supply and demand; c) increase quality and effectiveness of SSTC exchange; and d) provide institutional memory.

Category of the assignment: National
Proposed level of assignment: Junior Level
Section:  Communication, Advocacy and Partnerships (CAP) 
Duration: 11.5 months 
Background and purpose
UNICEF is working with the Government of Rwanda to implement the Country Programme 2018-2023. The overall aim of the Country Programme is to accelerate progress towards the realization of all rights of all children.
The programme of cooperation seeks to achieve sustainable results for children at various stages of the life cycle, and is focused on selected outcomes related to health, education, early childhood development, nutrition, water and sanitation and child protection.
Special emphasis in both development and humanitarian contexts is put on applying Communication for Development (C4D) as a strategy to effectively promote social and behavioural change among caregivers and other immediate duty-bearers and address harmful social norms. This strategy contributes to reducing barriers to the equitable realization of children’s rights in family and community settings in a more sustainable and efficient manner.
The National Early Childhood Education Programme (NECDP) is one of the key partners of UNICEF. Currently, NECDP in coordination with multiple partners and stakeholders is implementing the National Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) Strategy for Integrated ECD, Nutrition and WASH (2018-2024), with the overarching aim of reducing the level of stunting among children below the age of five.
The purpose of the proposed assignment is to further strengthen the strategic C4D capacity of NECDP in support of the National SBCC Strategy implementation.

Therefore, UNICEF seeks services of National Individual Contractor who will contribute to strengthening the strategic C4D interventions in support of the National SBCC Strategy implementation led by NECDP.
 
Objectives
 
The National Contractor under the supervision of the Head of Nutrition and Hygiene Department, NECDP and guidance of UNICEF C4D Specialist will work closely with the NECDP and UNICEF teams to  enhance social and behaviour change communication, social mobilization and advocacy activities for Integrated ECD, Nutrition and WASH.
Key expected results:
• Support provided to NECDP and UNICEF in coordination, implementation and monitoring of the communication, advocacy social mobilization and community engagement interventions for Integrated ECD, Nutrition and WASH, including in the context of COVID-19 response.
• Support provided to NECDP and UNICEF in coordination, maintenance and further strengthening partnerships with all relevant stakeholders, including government entities, international organizations, civil society and private sector in support of the implementation of the National SBCC Strategy for Integrated ECD, Nutrition and WASH.
• Support provided to ensure that the key joint communication interventions in support of Integrated ECD, Nutrition and WASH SBC communications agreed in the work-plan between NECDP and UNICEF for the period of 2020-2021 are rolled out as per set timelines, the progress is regularly monitored and possible implementation challenges are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

Risks associated with the contract
 
Risk: Considering that the assignment involves multiple stakeholders and complications posed by COVID-19 pandemic, the anticipated timelines may potentially be missed and subsequently, the delays may occur.
Mitigation: During the inception phase, there will be considerable investment made in consensus building on key approaches and methodologies and the work modalities among the Contractor, NECDP and UNICEF. NECDP and partners will try as much as possible to identify potential bottlenecks, promote active discussions and secure consensus through the technical working groups and other relevant platforms.
Risk: Since the payments will be processed on a monthly basis against expected deliverables, there is a risk of paying for the full contract duration, whilst the full assignment is not completed, resulting in cost contract extension requests.
Mitigation: the primary and secondary supervisors will closely supervise the contractor and ensure such situation doesn’t occur. In case any of the expected deliverables are not provided in due course, the reasons will be documented in the form of the email exchange between the contractor and the direct and secondary supervisors, and the contractor will submit the invoice and report once the particular expected deliverables are finalized. Therefore, there might be instances when combined invoices and reports for two or more months might be submitted by the contractor for processing of the payment, subject to certification by the direct and secondary supervisors.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.
Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.
And we never give up.
For every child, innovate...
UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children. We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children’s rights are critical to improving their lives
The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the startup thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions. UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:

Connecting youth communities (or more broadly -- anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.
Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach -- in a traditionally risk-averse field -- to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.
Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.

The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs – and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively.
How can you make a difference?
In coming years drones will be fully incorporated into commercial airspace. Will we be ready? How can we use these emerging technologies to help children? UNICEF Innovation is looking at the future of drones (UAV/Ss, RPAs), for humanitarian response and development. Though they are a new technology, their potential use in imagery, connectivity and transport situations will be integral. Drones can be helpful, for example, in mudslides in humanitarian and refugee flooding situations, by bringing connectivity to disconnected areas and for transporting important medical supplies to hard-to-reach places.
UNICEF has identified drone technology and drone-based services as a means to strengthen and improve its work in global health and community resilience. The Office of Innovation is supporting the organization to better understand these opportunities, address key considerations on the use of drones, and craft a practical way forward for UNICEF to globally leverage this technology in protecting and advancing the rights of children.
UNICEF has established implementation hubs to test drones for humanitarian and development applications. These hubs provide new platforms for data collection, stakeholder engagement and youth capacity building:
1) In collaboration with the Government of Vanuatu, UNICEF supported the implementation of the first vaccine drone delivery network in the world. The drone companies have delivered vaccines, syringes and other medical and non-medical goods to different locations in the country.
2) In Malawi, UNICEF launched the first humanitarian drone testing corridor with the Government in 2017. Since then, several companies, universities and research centres from all over the world have participated in Malawi’s corridor to test their drone technologies and services. In January 2020, UNICEF launched the African Drone and Data Academy which is the first educational institution for African youth to get a free education on how to build, operate and maintain drones, and get certified in this area of technology.
3) In Kazakhstan, UNICEF supported the Government to implement and manage a drone corridor to test the use of drones in disaster preparedness and emergency response. Several Central Asian drone companies have tested their technology in this corridor for search and rescue operations, wildfire response and mountain mapping.
4) In Sierra Leone, UNICEF supported the launch of a humanitarian drone testing corridor with the objective to test the technology in the delivery of medical supplies to reduce the risk of maternal mortality for women in remote rural communities. Sierra Leone's drone corridor explores the use of aerial drones for medical deliveries, emergency response activities, agroforestry and geospatial mapping.
Through the UNICEF Venture Fund, UNICEF has invested in six drone startups developing open source software and hardware solutions to support the use of UAS in humanitarian use cases. These seed investments to entrepreneurs will accelerate the development of digital public goods in the drone technology sector. These digital public goods can be either the design and blueprints to build low-cost and long-endurance drones for the delivery of medical supplies under an open-source license, or open-source algorithms to model precipitation and floods that help to better identify households at risk. Each investment within this cohort has the potential to improve efficiencies within UNICEF’s programmes, creating solutions that contribute to improve the living conditions of the most disadvantaged children.
Your main responsibilities will be:

Provide technical support to implement training programmes required to develop UNICEF regional and country offices’ capacity to use UAS, as a tool to improve service delivery for children.
In coordination with the Global Drones Lead, supporting UNICEF’s Drones Working Group--composed of participants from UNICEF programs, offices and divisions; as well as with a global, regional and country representation--to integrate the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in delivery, imagery and connectivity use cases, where it makes more sense to support UNICEF’s mission.
Provide technical support to the UNICEF ICTD and Office of Innovation as well as country-level drone-focused initiatives, including implementation and management of drone testing corridors, use of UAS to support programmatic work, integration of UAS into health supply chains for the delivery of medical supplies, among other UAS initiatives.
In coordination with ICTD, the Globlal Drones Lead and the Office of Innovation team build and maintain partnerships with interagency entities, NGOs, private sector, among others, in relation to UAS use in development and humanitarian missions.

To qualify as an advocate for every child you will have…

Information:
Title of Assignment: 
Feasibility Study for the Upgrade of Rwanda Electronic Medical Records (EMR) & Hospital Management Information Systems (HIMSs)
Category of the Consultancy:     International
Proposed level of Consultancy: Middle Level
Section: Health
Duration: 3 months
Location:  Rwanda (at central level, in health facilities and communities)
Background and Purpose
Rwanda has made significant progress in implementing various Digital Health solutions over the past decade. A five-year Digital Health strategic plan was endorsed in 2009 and the country has been exemplary in Africa in implementing Digital Health solutions at a national scale. The Rwandan Health Sector has so far made significant investment in eHealth initiatives in a bid to improve the delivery of health service. A number of information systems have been put in place including: the integrated routine reporting Health Management Information System,  Electronic Medical Records, Electronic Logistics Management Information Systems, Mobile community based information systems, Human Resources Information system, Resource tracking information system, Laboratory Information System, Integrated Disease Surveillance Information Systems, Health Resource Tracking Tool, Blood bank information system and telemedicine network.
These interventions were needed considering that the Health Sector was dealing with epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, other new diseases and needed to provide efficient healthcare services, obtain timely and quality data in order to make informed public health decisions. Despite many successful interventions and major investments in the sector, there are still challenges such as:• The earlier interventions focused more on routine reporting and disease surveillance systems;  • The deployed systems are in silos and with little integration;• There are challenges to collect timely information for easy and quick decision-making, not enough ability to track service levels across the entire health sector. Particularly, for the electronic Medical Records and Hospital the Health Sector faces the following key challenges: • OpenMRS deployments are not standardized. Different health facilities have different module packages installed; Patient journey not fully automated from registration to exit;• Medical records in hospitals and health centers are not fully digitalized and this renders sharing of medical records and patients follow up very difficult;• Modules are not smoothly integrated with each other’s, Modules like Pharmacy, Laboratory and Consultation not implemented, Billing Module not fully automated; • There is a large number of healthcare facilities that need HIMS/EMR deployment including health posts;• Due implementation on local servers, systems are not stable and present risks considering that backups are kept on the same servers;• OpenMRS is running on an old version. Due to the extensive customization that has been done, it will take significant effort to upgrade it to the latest version later on adding more modules to have a full integrated Hospital Management information System; • All current OpenMRS installations are not integrated with each other with other health information systems such as HIMS, eLMIS, etc. • There is a very small local IT team at the facility to support the installation of OpenMRS thus difficulties to implement and maintain local, separate installations;• There is a lack of standardized governance and security processes for health records considering that Information security and data privacy are very key elements to cater for. There is a great need to guarantee that Patients medical records are secure and respect privacy;• Lack of Infrastructure in some of health facilities (LAN, internet connectivity.)
At health Post level, there is not specific individual based reporting system implemented but HMIS has been disaggregated to allow health post entering their routine data (monthly basis).
At community level, the Rapid SMS is mostly used by all CHWs for emergency notification. It is used to track the pregnancy life cycle, neonatal care (NC) and postnatal care (PNC), community case management (CCM), severe malaria and nutrition status (CBN) for a complete tracking of the mother and newborn throughout the first 5 years of the child’s life. There is also a monthly SISCOM report aggregated at HC level to be uploaded in DHIS2. The CHWs of a village give a monthly activity report to the cell supervisor. The cell supervisor combines the reports from all villages in the cell into a monthly cell report and the CHWs coordinator at the health center consolidates the cell reports into a single Health Center report he uploads into DHIS2. The current system presents some limitations:• Limited on emergency cases (not cover all programs);• Difficult to manipulate (uses SMS);• Parallel reporting between RapidSMS and SISCOM• No Smooth interaction between CHW and their supervisors• Mixing both paper and electronic reporting Operates in silos
 
Justification
 
Considering the challenges to have a fully digitalized and integrated health system across all points of care in the health sector, the following improvements have been proposed:
• Automate processes including medical records and billing to improve patient experience and service delivery in all health facilities;• Have fully fledged Hospital Management Information system that can be customized according to health service package in public health facilities starting from Health center to referral hospital. The HIMS solution should fulfill all the requirements of hospitals as well as health centers by automating the entire patient journey starting from appointment scheduling, registration, consultations, billing, imaging, laboratory order and responses, prescription of medication and dispensing;• To centralize the deployment of EMR and HIMS in a cloud environment for easy deployment, operation and maintenance;• To provide interconnection capabilities with external modules including health insurance (RSSB, MINECOFIN's, Pharmacies, etc…);• To put a suitable EMR system at health posts;• To put in place a new comprehensive system that incorporates all CHWs activities including emergency reporting. The new system for CHW should work on Smart phones for increased functionality;• Implement an integrated, comprehensive information system across all the healthcare facilities nationwide in a timely, efficient and seamless manner. • Enable Implement data interoperability at all levels (CHW, Health Post, Health Center, Hospitals) and ensure data exchange with other systems within and outside the health sector;• Transforming the delivery of healthcare services by creating a shared patient record that will serve as the primary source of information for all patients, healthcare providers and other related health service users• Transforming the overall level of healthcare delivery in Rwanda while lowering costs and protecting patient confidentiality.• Improve patient care and management mechanisms in healthcare facilities as well as improving accessibility to quality of health care services at all levels of health care provision.• Improve the quality and timeliness of routine data for public health decision-making, disease surveillance and response, medical stock and human resource management and planning. • Improve the quality and impact of preventive treatment care through patient centric service delivery care, accountability, and transparency in the delivery of medical procedures • Provide standardization across the health sector and at all levels of healthcare service provision. • Improve system integration and interoperability both within the Health Sector and with the relevant systems that are external to the Health Sector.
The proposed upgrades of EMR and HIMS have been grouped into two categories:• Full EMR & HIMS: for health centers and hospitals (District hospital, Provincial Hospital and Referral Hospital)• Lightweight EMR: for community health workers (CHWs) and Health Posts (HPs)To achieve the planned improvements mentioned above, a Feasibility Study has been proposed to make a detailed assessment of the proposed improvements for the EMR and HIMS, proposed the proper approach and a solid implementation plan that are prerequisite for successful implementation of the planned upgrade of EMR and the overall HIMS.Objectives

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does - in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life - in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions - her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens - addressing inequity - not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.

About UNICEF 
If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.
BACKGROUND
The UNICEF Strategic Plan (SP) is a four-year corporate plan setting out our organizational vision to deliver results for children and realize their rights. It also articulates how UNICEF will support the countries achieve the child-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
UNICEF will formally present the final version of the SP 2022-2025 at the Second Regular Session of the Executive Board in September 2021.  SP 2022-2025 will be developed in the context of extraordinary times as the world deals with an unprecedented health crisis with far-reaching socio-economic consequences, the full scale of which has yet to be determined.  In the context of uncertainty, one clear learning is that even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the world was already not on track to achieve a significant number of SDG targets for children, as gleaned from the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of SP 2018-2021.  For instance, in 2019, almost a billion children already lived in countries where the SDGs remained out of reach. 
The SP 2022-2025 will be of utmost importance, as it should express UNICEF’s commitment to delivering tangible results for especially the most disadvantaged children everywhere and elucidate UNICEF’s ambition for the Decade of Action and its contribution to the SDGs.  It is instrumental that the new SP is developed and new baselines and targets established based on learnings from a rigorous analysis of the current SP.  Careful and thorough assessments will further improve the alignment of the new SP at all levels and provide a set of guidance for UNICEF to critically examine its corporate performance. 
The consultant will support the Strategic Planning and Corporate Analysis (SPCA) team in Strategic Planning, Implementation, Monitoring and Reporting (SPIMR) section in the Division of Data, Analysis, Planning, and Monitoring (DAPM) with regard to:

Assessing SP alignment to inform regional contribution to the new SP baselines and targets
Analysing SP performance in light of socio-economic impact of COVID-19,  beyond the statutory monitoring and reporting of the SP progress rates to UNICEF senior management and the Executive Board, and help respond to the Executive Board decision 2020/8 (explained below).

Terms of Reference / Deliverables
Under the overall guidance of the SPCA team and technical lead of the Planning Specialist, the consultant will undertake the following work and produce analytical documents (in-depth for internal consumption and summary for sharing with wider audience) and PowerPoint presentations:

SP alignment


Purpose: To inform assessment of regional/country contribution to the new SP results and help ensure that the new SP is anchored in regional or country-level plans or programmes.
Tasks:

Assess the alignment of the current SP Goal Areas and Change Strategies by conducting comparative analysis with regional priorities, Regional Office Management Plans and corresponding indicators, or equivalent.
Examine whether enough regions/countries are working on certain areas to achieve the respective SP targets, and help respond whether UNICEF is setting its ambition at the right level
Appraise whether the results/successes are measured using the same approach or metric at global, regional and country levels




SP performance 


Purpose: To inform the baseline and target-setting of the new SP, by understanding which output-level targets the performance is on track
Tasks:

In collaboration with Divisions, assess the SP performance by result areas, while reflecting the health and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 to the best degree possible
In collaboration with Divisions, identify the regions and countries where the sectoral performance needs to be accelerated
Examine whether performance is different for certain indicator types than others (e.g. service delivery, systems strengthening, policy advocacy, etc.)
Explore possible correlation between change strategies and Goal Area/Result Area performance

SAFE TO LEARN
Safe to Learn was launched in 2019 as a global initiative to catalyse commitments and evidence-based action to end violence in and through schools by 2030.  As a joint initiative of the violence against children (VAC) and education sectors, Safe to Learn is an opportunity to unlock the multiple wins of ending violence in schools, improve learning outcomes, better leverage investments in education, and raise awareness and change attitudes towards VAC more broadly.
The Safe to Learn Call to Action, a high-level political tool, sets out five areas where change needs to happen to end violence in and through schools.  A strategic Roadmap details these areas and identifies how diverse partners can accelerate the achievement of Safe to Learn's ambitious goals. 
Safe to Learn is hosted by the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children (End Violence Partnership), which has guided its progress to date and engaged key education organizations and funders in its development.[1]  To deliver on its full ambition, Safe to Learn now needs even greater buy-in, co-creation and co-ownership from both the VAC and education sectors.
END VIOLENCE PARTNERSHIP
 Every year, over 1 billion children experience violence.  Violence in childhood undermines all other investments in children: in their health, education and development, often with negative lifelong consequences and intergenerational impact. Recognizing the devastating impacts of violence against children, in 2015 world leaders committed to end all forms of violence, abuse and neglect by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. In July 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and an associated Fund.
The End Violence Partnership includes governments, UN agencies, international organizations, civil society, faith groups, the private sector, philanthropic foundations, research practitioners, academics and children themselves - uniting their voices, actions and resources in a unique public-private collaboration focused solely on ending all violence against children.
In its first four years, the Partnership has helped develop and promote the INSPIRE solutions to end violence; enrolled 30 governments as 'Pathfinder' countries; launched an innovative initiative with education sector partners to end violence in and through schools; awarded over $40 million in grants to tackle violence against children online and in humanitarian situations; welcomed over 450 organizations as members; and galvanized those working to end violence through collective advocacy and events including the inaugural End Violence Solutions Summit.
THE OPPORTUNITY
COVID-19 has disrupted learning for nearly all children.  At times during 2020, almost 1.5 billion children were out of school and physically isolated at home due to the pandemic, facing higher risks of domestic violence and greater exposure to online abuse as learning and leisure moved more online.  COVID-19 has also raised awareness of violence against children, and the important role that schools play for children's health, well-being and safety, beyond the educational benefits.
Building on the initial progress of Safe to Learn, and as COVID-19 prompts educationalists to reimagine some aspects of learning, there is an opportunity to translate the audacious ambition of zero violence in schools into a reality in every country. This will require leadership-level agreement on a small number of priority actions that will make a significant difference in every country, coupled with a step-change in collective advocacy, action and investment to make it happen.
The Safe to Learn Director will work with current and new partners to develop this vision and the shared workplan that will be needed to deliver it.  The ideal candidate will be a proactive leader with experience of galvanizing high-impact coalitions within the international development sector. Experience and understanding of how international partners/funders operate at country level will be important, as will an appreciation for how a global initiative can catalyse country-level change.  Knowledge of both the VAC and education sectors and strong networks within both would be an advantage, as would experience of mobilizing financial resources.  S/he will have a proven ability to lead a (small) team, balancing short-term deliverables with measurable progress against an ambitious longer-term strategy.  S/he will build relationships with Safe to Learn partners, thought leaders and experts, the wider VAC and education sectors and champions, to deliver change and help influence global attention and approaches to ending violence in and through schools.
MANAGEMENT, LOCATION, TRAVEL AND DURATION
 The Safe to Learn Director will be hosted by the Secretariat of the End Violence Partnership, based in New York.  S/he will work alongside and in close partnership with the Executive Director to deliver Safe to Learn's ambitious goals. S/he will be a member of a small End Violence Leadership Team, collaborating with those leading complementary work to make children Safe at Home and Safe Online.  S/he will manage a small team and will contribute to a culture of professionalism that emphasizes curiosity, learning, collaboration and delivery.
COVID-19 has prompted remote and more flexible working, and we do not expect to return to full-time office-based working.  Therefore, the location of the Safe to Learn Director is open to discussion with well-qualified applicants; our priority is to identify the right person to lead Safe to Learn in its exciting next phase.
COVID-19 has also temporarily curtailed international business travel.  As and when business travel is possible, some international travel will be expected.
The position will initially be for two years.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
 In addition to leading the Safe to Learn team and contributing to the Leadership Team of the EVAC Secretariat, the primary responsibilities of the Safe to Learn Director are to:

Provide visionary leadership to Safe to Learn as a co-owned, co-created initiative of the VAC and education sectors;
Facilitate/lead the development of a multi-year strategy that builds on the Call to Action and Roadmap and includes a set of evidence-based interventions - jointly developed by VAC and education actors - that will deliver a step-change in collective advocacy, action and investment to end violence in and through schools by 2030; and

Build and sustain effective working relationships with an expanded Safe to Learn coalition (UK FCDO, UNICEF, UNESCO, CSO, UNGEI GPE, WB, ECW etc.) navigating competing organizational priorities to ensure action in support of the collective ambition for safe schools and the policy, advocacy and programmatic synergies needed to deliver that;
Inform, excite, guide and support End Violence governing body members as Safe to Learn advocates, donors and programmatic partners; and
Champion and expand the Safe to Learn network by securing the buy-in of diverse partners and constituencies (civil society, business, academia, young people, etc.).

Mobilize resources to implement the strategy and realise Safe to Learn goals

Develop and deliver with Safe to Learn partners a resource mobilization plan to raise the resources to support delivery of the ambitious multi-year strategy;
Mobilize resources for the Safe to Learn window of the End Violence Fund to support delivery of the multi-year strategy, building on its value and impact through investments in replicable and scalable initiatives to generate evidence of what works

For every child,
BackgroundMaternal and Child Health (MCH) remains a priority in Tajikistan's National Development and Health Sector policies and strategies including Tajikistan's commitment to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Despite significant gains in the last decade, Maternal and Child Health (MCH) outcomes in Tajikistan are worse than the average in Central Asia and Caucasus regions. Rates of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are high. 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSPP) to implement a Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care (MCHIC) Project within the purview of the National Health Strategy 2010-2020. The project aims at improving the health status and well-being of mothers and children in 3 districts (Shamsuddin Shohin, Rasht, and Fayzobod) focusing on the integrated MCH care delivery at both primary and secondary health care levels. The MCHIC project targets the following three outputs: (i) Integrated quality MCH services delivery improved in project districts; (ii) MCH services rationalized, upgraded, equipped and case-based payment system piloted in project targeted districts; and (iii) Knowledge on maternal and child health and health-seeking behavior improved through various communication activities implemented.
Community-based activities under the project will to be guided by the SBCC strategy, targeting both health providers and population with the aim to improve health and nutrition related knowledge, attitudes and practices to enforce appropriate health seeking behavior. The strategy will focus on the constraints of limited health and nutrition related knowledge and health seeking behaviors, sub-standard communication practices and capacity of health service providers and adverse socio-cultural beliefs and adverse traditions. The communication strategy and activities will focus on pregnant and young mothers, mothers-in-law, male family members, with special attention on heads of family and members of the Mahalla, including religious leaders as influencing persons and communities.

The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC), led by UNICEF, was established in 2006 as part of the Humanitarian Reform process, which aimed to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response programmes by ensuring greater predictability, accountability and partnership. The Global Nutrition Cluster (GNC) is a partnership that includes international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, UN organizations, donors and individuals. In 2015, the GNC undertook an assessment of its technical role along with the Rapid Response Team (RRT) evaluation. Both exercises identified serious gaps in addressing nutrition technical needs in humanitarian contexts.  In March 2016, the GNC constituted a Technical Task Force (TTF) co-chaired by UNICEF and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to review recommendations and propose a mechanism to address nutrition technical gaps. One mechanism was endorsed in March 2017 and is called the “Global Technical Assistance Mechanism for Nutrition” (GTAM).
The GTAM is a common global mechanism endorsed by over 40 Global Nutrition Cluster partners to provide systematic, predictable, timely and coordinated nutrition technical assistance in order to meet the nutrition rights and needs of people affected by emergencies.
