The Gavi Secretariat

Main Duties/Responsibilities
The Director, Fragile & Conflict Countries leads engagement with Gavi-eligible countries that face significant fragility due to challenges such as very weak government institutions, high economic and political instability & displacement of people due to conflict, natural disasters, etc. These countries require a differentiated approach that includes simplified and more flexible processes, strengthened engagement with broad range of partners including international NGOs and local civil society organisations, and an increased risk appetite to enable Gavi and its partners to deliver programmes in highly challenging environments. Gavi’s 2021-2025 strategy makes equity – with a focus on reaching “zero-dose” (those children who have not received any routine vaccines) and under-immunised children with a full course of vaccines – our overarching priority.
The Fragile & Conflict Countries team is composed of six Senior Country Managers (SCMs) and four Programme Managers (PMs), and is responsible for effective stewardship of Gavi resources in 12 countries to deliver timely and sustainable results in accordance with Gavi’s strategy 2021-2025.

Drive performance and achievement of the relevant key performance indicators (equitable and sustainable uptake of vaccine programmes).
Ensure adherence to, and optimisation of, Gavi portfolio management processes.
Coordinate and strengthen collaboration with Alliance partners and other partners and stakeholders at the global level.
Encourage a diverse mix of partners across immunisation, health and beyond to leverage comparative advantages.

Provide guidance on leveraging the Fragility, Emergencies and Refugees Policy (FER) for tailored and adapted approaches to address needs in fragile, humanitarian, and other emergency settings.
Strengthen advocacy efforts to engage communities, governments, and other partners - and enhance political will, potentially including efforts to advocate for the prioritisation of immunisation and health system strengthening within humanitarian assessment and planning processes, and within humanitarian coordination mechanisms.

Job Description
BACKGROUND
Gavi pursues an ambitious mission in poor and fragile countries, operates in a dynamic and often uncertain context, and is set up as an Alliance of partners with a lean Secretariat without in-country presence. It is therefore naturally exposed to many risks that could potentially affect its ability to achieve its mission and strategic objectives. It also needs to consciously take calculated risks to achieve impact. Robust risk management is vital for Gavi to confidently take the risks required to achieve its mission, safeguard investments and secure sustainable impact. By systematically understanding, acknowledging and anticipating what might happen (before it actually does happen) and proactively monitoring and managing Gavi’s exposures to potential future events, risk management helps Gavi to optimise its impact and appropriately balance risk and reward. Since 2015, when the Risk function was first established, Gavi has made tremendous progress in enhancing its risk management approach to be a value-adding proactive management tool (instead of being reporting and compliance oriented). Today it is recognised by Board members, donors and management as leading edge in the sector and the risk lens drives strategic discussions both at Board-level and across the organisation. See for more information on Gavi’s risk management approach: https://www.gavi.org/our-alliance/strategy/risk-management.
Gavi stands at the start of its “Gavi 5.0” strategic period with a new strategy that is inherently more risky as it represents a very aspirational ambition requiring more and novel support to countries to reach missed communities and zero-dose children in hard-to-reach areas and challenging operating environments. On top of that, the COVID-19 pandemic is now exposing Gavi to new, heightened and rapidly changing risks as Gavi responds to it by supporting countries to maintain, restore and strengthen their immunisation services, and by administrating the COVAX Facility, a global mechanism to pool resources and demand for COVID-19 vaccines with the goal of accelerating the availability of and equitable access to safe and efficacious vaccines. It is critical that Gavi’s existing risk management framework is further developed to adequately identify, measure, monitor and manage these new risks to Gavi’s strategy, operations and programmes, as well as specific financial, reputational, operational and programmatic risks associated with the COVAX Facility.
In Gavi, risk management is everyone’s responsibility and an integral part of strategy and operations. Gavi has structured its risk management and assurance functions according to the Three Lines model with first line business functions monitoring and actively managing risks, second line functions providing objective specialist advice and appropriate checks and balances, and a third line audit function to provide independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management by the first and second lines. Gavi’s Risk function is a key second line function working closely with the core business to enable them to manage the risks they need to take or are exposed to in pursuing Gavi’s objectives. It also plays a key role in ensuring the three lines work together effectively in managing cross-cutting risks across the organisation. 
The Risk function is situated in the Executive Office and is responsible for monitoring risk on an enterprise-wide and strategic level, promoting a risk-aware culture and effective risk management practices throughout the organisation, and establishing regular risk reporting including to the Gavi Board (with risk being a standing agenda item). It also facilitates the Secretariat’s Risk Committee (chaired by the CEO with senior leadership from across the organisation) and supports risk owners with risk analysis and structuring of strategic discussions on Gavi’s top risks in Risk Committee and Board meetings.
 

Main Duties/Responsibilities
The Senior Risk Manager position is a full-time permanent role based in Geneva, Switzerland. It provides a great opportunity to help lead Senior Management's strategic thinking on mission-critical risks and to work across all key areas of Gavi's strategy and operations – and contribute to saving millions of children's' lives each year. Working closely with the Head of Risk as part of a small team within a dynamic organisation, the role will provide ample opportunity to take initiative and shape the future direction of Gavi’s evolving risk management approach, helping Gavi to better understand and proactively manage its key risks.
Main duties and responsibilities include:
•    Maintain and continue to enhance a robust enterprise-wide risk management framework for Gavi’s strategy, operations, and country programmes;
•    Help to drive change across the Alliance by instilling a risk-aware culture and enable scale-up and integration of risk management practices in strategic and operational planning and decision-making;
•    Assist in the preparation and facilitation of Risk Committee meetings by supporting risk owners with deep dives on top risks, including by data analysis and research, and drive strategic thinking on implications and trade-offs;
•    Coordinate the integration of risk insights in team priorities, performance and budget discussions;
•    Engage actively with internal risk-related functions (e.g. Legal, Finance, Audit), external risk management advisors (e.g. investment banks, insurance industry), and other relevant stakeholders (e.g. Alliance partners) as required to ensure cross-cutting and end-to-end risk management;
•    Prepare actionable and insightful risk reporting for internal reviews and reporting to Gavi Board and Committees as required;
•    Assist in discussions on Gavi’s current risk management capabilities and Three Lines model, identifying potential improvement areas across teams as well as in the overall model used;
•    Act as deputy for the Head of Risk and represent the Risk function in meetings as required.
Note: The essential functions listed in this section are not exhaustive of the job responsibilities; other duties may be assigned consistently with the department needs.
 

Work Experience
•    Minimum of 8 years of professional experience in (enterprise-level) risk management, strategy, or related fields;
•    Consulting experience combined with strong practical experience in applying risk management pragmatically in complex organisations and / or international development is an asset.
 

Skills/Competencies
•    Excellent analytical and systems thinking and demonstrated problem-solving skills;
•    Ability to develop a strategic perspective and creatively think outside the box;
•    Interdisciplinary mindset with a broad interest in various fields and eagerness to learn;
•    Well-honed interpersonal and influencing skills across seniority levels and a thoughtful listener;
•    Pragmatic hands-on management style and the ability to reduce complexity and deliver results;
•    Ability to work autonomously, under pressure, demonstrating initiative and flexibility;
•    Team player able to establish working relationships with many teams in a multicultural environment;
•    Excellent writing skills and attention for detail;
•    Competence with digital tools and ability to work quickly and accurately with them; 
•    Willingness to work in a fast-paced, ambiguous and constantly changing environment;
•    A positive, can-do attitude and a sense of humour.
 

Languages
•    Written and spoken fluency in English;
•    French and other languages are an asset.
 

Academic Qualifications
•    University degree in business or public administration, science or engineering, global health or development, or related fields;
•    Further qualifications in enterprise, operational or financial risk management are an asset.

Contacts
•    Collaboration with all teams in Gavi Secretariat and the Office of the COVAX Facility;
•    Frequent interactions with Head of Risk and Chief of Staff;
•    Regular exposure to Senior Management, including CEO and Deputy CEO;
•    As required interactions with Alliance partners, COVAX Facility stakeholders and Gavi Board constituencies.
