Job Description
Gavi is committed to securing a global response to COVID-19 that is effective and fair, using its unique expertise to help identify and rapidly accelerate development, production and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines under the principle that no one is safe unless everyone is safe.
As part of broader efforts to secure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, Gavi has launched the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. All countries are invited to participate in this Facility, which will pool demand and resources and secure supply of COVID-19 vaccines through entering into advance purchase commitments with manufacturers. The Gavi Secretariat is currently coordinating efforts together with global health partners to complete the design and accelerate operationalisation of this Facility with the goal of securing 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 to vaccinate the highest priority populations globally.
Within the COVAX Facility, an innovative financing instrument – the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) launched at the Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June – is being used to secure access to timely and sufficient supply of COVID-19 vaccines for 92 low and lower-middle income economies specifically.
