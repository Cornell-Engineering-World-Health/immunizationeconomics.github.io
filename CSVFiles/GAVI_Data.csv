Job Description
We are committed to fostering a just, equitable and diverse culture free from racism and discrimination in which all staff, partners and stakeholders feel empowered, safe and heard.
BACKGROUND
Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has immunized more than 822 million children, saving more than 14 million lives. At the recent Replenishment meeting on 4 June 2020, Gavi raised $8.8 billion through direct contributions and other innovative financing sources, including new pledges to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm). These funds will support Gavi’s 2021–2025 goal of reaching another 300 million children with life-saving vaccines, bringing the total number of children vaccinated to 1.1 billion by the end of 2025. This renewed commitment from donors and partners will help countries prevent disease, protect their communities and, above all, prosper. 
The crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic is has quickly taken hold in many developing countries. For nations with fragile health systems, this is already having a catastrophic impact. Gavi is taking urgent action in making sure we protect the next generation through routine immunisation where possible and campaigns where necessary; reinforcing health and immunisation systems against COVID-19 and rebuilding them after the shock and; fast-tracking coronavirus vaccines that will be equitably delivered. This critical moment requires additional resources from diverse and sustainable sources, and for available financing to be leveraged strategically and efficiently to unlock the greatest level of impact possible. Important to Gavi’s success in supporting the global response to COVID is a comprehensive approach to attract, retain, and multiply financial and business resources of the private sector, sovereign donors, and other development institutions. The aim of this strategy is to better support countries, partners, and the Gavi secretariat, by diversifying resourcing to ensure sustainability in immunisation and safeguarding greater global health security. 
Gavi has had the opportunity to engage with new investors in a variety of ways. As economic growth continues in many emerging markets, new players and middle-income countries will become more prominent in the global space.  Therefore, existing donor relationship needs must continue to be met, while developing and executing a forward-looking and comprehensive strategy, leveraging the changing landscape and  proactively engage emerging economies as new investors and technical partners, through innovative partnership models. Equally important, private sector partnerships and innovation will also be central to this approach as Gavi reaches to further accelerate its impact, while achieving greater efficiencies. 
The Resource Mobilisation, Private Sector Partnerships and Innovative Finance (RMPSPIF) department supports the Alliance by ensuring sustainable donor financing and enhanced resource innovation. This includes (i) converting pledges into contribution agreements for the 2021-2025 period and new additional fundraising efforts (COVAX AMC) to deploy the COVID-19 response; (ii) diversifying Gavi’s financing base to include new and emerging donors, development institutions, regional banks, and the private sector (iii) bringing to bear the innovation and resources through new and expanded partnerships, innovative financing, and other initiatives; and (iv) leading key fundraising and reporting exercises.

The market shaping team contributes to achieving Gavi’s mission by shaping the markets for vaccines and other immunisation products. This includes the objectives of ensuring adequate and secure supply of quality vaccines; reducing prices of vaccines and other immunisation products to an appropriate and sustainable level; and incentivising development of suitable and quality vaccines and other immunisation products. Guided by the Gavi Supply and Procurement Strategy, the Market Shaping team: 
•    Develops, coordinates, communicates and contributes to the implementation of evidence-based supply and procurement strategies for Gavi-funded vaccines (Strategy and Tender Hub). 
•    Leads cross-cutting strategic projects that help address broad and complex Alliance questions or long-standing market challenges or issues, in support of the market shaping supply and procurement objectives and the Alliance goals.
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT FOR THE ASSIGNMENT
In the 2016-2020 Supply and Procurement Strategy, the Alliance upheld innovation as one of three priorities in shaping markets to the benefit of the countries that Gavi supports, aiming to pursue a common agenda on driving product innovation to better meet country needs and support Alliance goals on immunisation coverage and equity. The Vaccine Innovation Prioritisation Strategy (VIPS) was formed in 2017 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and led by the Market Shaping Projects Hub, and is a partnership between Gavi, the World Health Organization (WHO), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and PATH. 
Over the last three years, VIPS has represented an unprecedented collaboration amongst the aforementioned organisations, involving in-depth research, stakeholder consultations, and development and application of a framework capable of evaluating twenty-four technologies at different stages along the product development pipeline continuum. The work required understanding countries’ needs to consider the expected financial and non-financial impacts of innovations; developing common principles across the Alliance to measure the long-term benefits of product innovations; and convening a platform to articulate a clear and aligned perspective on priority product innovations. By prioritising innovations in vaccine products and communicating these priorities, the goal of VIPS is to provide greater clarity to manufacturers and partners to inform and influence investment decisions. The outcome of the prioritisation phase was prioritisation of three innovations:
•    Microarray patches (MAPs)
•    Heat stable and Controlled Temperature Chain (CTC) qualified vaccines 
•    Barcodes on primary packaging.
 
Alignment of the five VIPS organisations behind a comprehensive evaluation framework and consensus on the three priority innovations is a major and unique accomplishment, however catalysing the development or uptake of these innovations will be critical to achieving real impact and contribute to Gavi 5.0 goals. Hence, as a next step, the VIPS partners are now working to define end-to-end integrated strategies for MAPs and heat stable and CTC qualified vaccines, including developing five-year action plans, to accelerate their advancement for use in LMICs. A more comprehensive landscaping of activities for barcodes is also being conducted.
With the perspectives of the manufacturers / pharmaceutical industry, funders and countries in mind, the role aims at understanding and implementing what is needed to incentivise manufacturers and accelerate their research and production of innovative vaccine products and conduct activities to accelerate country uptake. It will require to consult, align, and develop proposals and implement them: 
•    to de-risk manufacturers’ investments, 
•    to conduct critical clinical trials or to address key data gaps, 
•    to identify and address key obstacles manufacturers and partners are facing about development,
•    to conduct implementation research or modelling to assess effectiveness and how these innovations might be used, 
•    to assess broad public health impact,
•    to clarify potential market demand and willingness to pay for these, and the regulatory pathways for such novel products, 
•    to ensure policy considerations are made early,
•    to ensure that clear procurement mechanisms and funding are available for these products. 
Additionally, VIPS partners aim to undertake cross-cutting activities relevant across innovations to tackle issues related to policy, procurement, and implementation and country choice.

BACKGROUND
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership committed to saving children's lives and protecting people's health by increasing equitable use of vaccines in lower-income countries. The Vaccine Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, technical agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and other private sector partners. Gavi uses innovative finance mechanisms, including co-financing by recipient countries, to secure sustainable funding and adequate supply of quality vaccines. 
Since 2000, Gavi has contributed to the immunisation of nearly 822 million children and the prevention of more than 14 million future deaths. At the Global Vaccine Summit in June 2020, world leaders pledged more than $8.8bn to ensure Gavi can continue to amplify this work and immunise another 300 million children by 2025.
A year later, the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging. In countries with already fragile health systems, this is likely to have a catastrophic impact. Through the ground-breaking COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), Gavi is working with the international community to take urgent action in accelerating access of COVID-19 vaccines and ensures availability to populations no matter where they live. This is the moment where more resources from diverse and sustainable sources are required, and that available financing must be leveraged strategically and efficiently to unlock the greatest level of impact possible.  The Gavi COVAX AMC has already secured significant financing from sovereign and private sector donors, and as the fundraising campaign for the Gavi COVAX AMC continues, the Gavi secretariat seeks to ensure sustainability in its ambitious immunisation programmes and safeguard global health security through helping put together the world’s response to the global COVID-19 crisis.
The Resource Mobilisation, Private Sector Partnerships & Innovative Finance (RMPSPIF) department supports the Alliance by ensuring sustainable donor financing and enhanced resources for innovation. This includes (i) converting pledges for the 2021-2025 period; (ii) fundraising for the COVAX AMC to support the global covid-19 response; (iii) diversifying Gavi’s financing base to include new and emerging donors, development institutions, regional banks, and the private sector (iv) bringing to bear the innovation and resources of the private sector through new and expanded partnerships, innovative financing, and other initiatives; and (v) leading key fundraising and reporting exercises.
Within RMPSPIF, the Private Sector Partnerships and Innovations team, nested in the New Investors Hub (NIH), is focused on mobilising financial resources from philanthropic investors, foundations and building partnerships with the private sector, and scaling innovations to advance Gavi’s objectives. To date, the team has pioneered the use of emerging technologies to accelerate vaccine delivery, built partnerships with global multinationals and leading country corporations, and created the INFUSE platform to identify high potential innovators. Over 2021-2025, the Private Sector Partnerships and Innovations team has an ambitious agenda to fully harness and scale private sector tools, technologies, and business models to advance Gavi’s goals and focus on unreached and under-immunised children with equity as the organising principle.
