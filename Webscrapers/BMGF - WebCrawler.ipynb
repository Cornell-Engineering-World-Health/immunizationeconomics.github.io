According to UN data, since 2000, the number of children worldwide who are of primary school age but are not in school has fallen from 99 to 58 million, even as the population of that age group has increased from 665 to 728 million. Despite this progress in access to schools, far too many children leave primary school without minimum proficiency in math and reading, an estimated 387 million globally, and in low-income countries, only 10% of children can read by the age of 10, compared with 90% in high-income countries. While the gender gap in access to primary schooling has shrunk, challenges remain in ensuring equal educational opportunities for girls, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been investing in global public goods (data, evidence, innovation) that can inform local education policy reform in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Since early 2020, we have expanded the scope of our work to more directly improve reading and math outcomes - also referred to as foundational literacy and numeracy - among children in the early grades in India and Sub-Saharan Africa.

IDM’s software models of infectious disease transmission simulate disease dynamics over a wide range of details and dimensions. Our models cover situations from generic influenza-like diseases to mechanistic models of host-borne diseases like malaria. Models can scale from single individuals to millions, and from single households to the entire globe. Smaller models can run on an individual researcher’s workstation, but big scenarios and large ensembles of simulations run on high performance computing clusters.

An employee may apply for an open position after at least 12 months in their current position. If you meet this requirement and wish to pursue a backfill opportunity, you are required to have a conversation with your manager to confirm their support before you apply. In rare cases, the requirement of a minimum of 12 months in a position may be waived if a transfer is critical to the foundation’s goals and is approved by the current manager and their HR Consultant (HR Business Partner or Generalist). All backfill positions are posted as LTE roles. With current manager support, if selected for the role, FTEs will retain their FTE status during the backfill assignment. Managers will have the option of backfilling for the individual moving to the interim position for a similar duration via the same hiring channels and options as this position.

An employee may apply for an open position after at least 12 months in their current position. If you meet this requirement and wish to pursue a backfill opportunity, you are required to have a conversation with your manager to confirm their support before you apply. In rare cases, the requirement of a minimum of 12 months in a position may be waived if a transfer is critical to the foundation’s goals and is approved by the current manager and their HR Consultant (HR Business Partner or Generalist). All backfill positions are posted as LTE roles. With current manager support, if selected for the role, FTEs will retain their FTE status during the backfill assignment. Managers will have the option of backfilling for the individual moving to the interim position for a similar duration via the same hiring channels and options as this position. However, current managers may be unwilling or unable to hold headcount for the duration of an interim assignment and may deny the employee’s request. In such cases, the employee may apply for the open LTE position, but if selected, would effectively be resigning as an FTE and would be hired as an LTE for the duration of the interim assignment. As an LTE, employment with the foundation is expected to end at the end of the assignment, and the employee would not be eligible for severance.

By working to expand access to life-changing opportunities with a primary focus on education, the foundation seeks to ensure that all students –especially Black and Latinx students, and students experiencing poverty – have an opportunity\\xa0to earn a degree or certificate that prepares them for a successful career and fulfilling life. The foundation understands that education alone is not enough as factors outside of schools and classrooms have an enormous impact on a student’s success. Through support to public officials and community groups, the foundation works to better understand and advance economic mobility, leading to permanent ladders out of poverty for families and communities, such that race, ethnicity, and income are no longer predictors of outcomes. USP’s goal is to help break the intergenerational cycle of poverty that prevents families and communities from accessing opportunities to reach their full potential by improving education systems and ensuring that race, ethnicity, and income are no longer predictors of outcomes. The U.S. Program works on seven key drivers toward our goal: Ensure early childhood learning systems provide high-quality early learning experiences for young children. Support schools in the K12 system in their work to improve student outcomes. Transform colleges and universities to increase student success and eliminate opportunity and attainment gaps. Create equitable access to quality education to employment pathways that enable students to obtain credentials of value and gain the professional skills, agency, and social capital to thrive in the workplace. Partner with stakeholders to ensure more effective collaborations to increase mobility from poverty, including a focus on data and evidence to close knowledge gaps and help leaders from various sectors work together to achieve even greater impact. Support improvements that will provide practitioners and policymakers with the education to workforce data and information they need to answer critical questions about student progress and to implement evidence-based reforms that equitably improve education outcomes. In the foundation’s home state of Washington, improve education from preschool through college, and strengthen community engagement, in order to ensure that every child has a chance to reach their full potential. Across our work in education, there are three keystones that anchor our strategies. These keystones are: Accelerate the development and delivery of high-quality, next generation instructional systems and digital learning resources that deliver equitable impact, with a focus on comprehensive instructional systems in early learning, math in K-12, and gateway courses in postsecondary. Enhance student transition supports that leverage technology and data to better enable counselors and advisors to engage students, increase students’ own sense of agency, and ensure equity in our priority students’ access to pathways that lead to economic mobility. Advance innovation in high school-to-postsecondary systems and models that lead to more accessible, affordable, high-quality pathways that support students in attaining a postsecondary credential with labor market value. These keystones reflect our belief in the power of evidence, data, technology, and innovation as essential and high potential inputs to support educators and system leaders to deliver equitable impact for students. \\xa0 Group Summary The newly focused Washington State Initiative (WSI) will reimagine how the power of the entire foundation’s work--its learning, its relationships, and its resources—can be brought to bear in support of Washington’s communities.
